The park had previously received funding from the European Union for various past and ongoing projects, which were key in establishing the rapid growth of the park. In a December 2018 issue from German magazine Kirmes Park & Revue, plans were confirmed to build a new 100 km/h (62 mph) double-launched coaster for the 2020 season, manufactured by frequent park supplier Vekoma.Track pieces for the new coaster began to arrive in late May 2019. In August 2019, Vekoma dropped the first concept artwork teasing the new attraction. At the IAAPA Expo Europe in Paris from September 17-19, 2019, Dutch design firm Jora Vision hosted a panel presenting the artwork and confirmed the area's official name; Aqualantis. The first animated POV of the ride was released on October 15, 2019. Abyssus was officially announced at a press conference on October 26, 2019, where park owner Marek Goczał presented the upcoming Aqualantis area in full.Site preparation for Aqualantis began in late July 2019. The summer and fall of 2019 were spent pouring foundations and digging trenches for Abyssus, and crews began erecting the coaster before the beginning of 2020. Abyssus was completed within two months of going vertical.
As per conditions with the European Union's provided funds, the park was contractually obligated to have Abyssus opened for April 6, 2020, a deadline that construction was thought to not be on track to achieve. These plans were disrupted by the then-incoming COVID-19 pandemic, and the decision was made in July 2020 to delay its debut to 2021.After the Aqualantis area began its brief soft-opening period on July 10, Abyssus officially opened to the public on July 14, 2021.",,4,3 trains with 4 cars.

To make way for the unnamed new coaster, the Looping Thunder coaster was set to be removed, and offered its last rides on September 24, 2017. Looping Thunder was a common Zyklon looping coaster from former Italian manufacturer Pinfari, and had opened in 1996. The coaster was dismantled by Seattle-based firm WBF Construction Services in November.Site preparation began in the winter of 2017/2018. WBF Construction Services was once again contracted to erect the coaster, in conjunction with Maryland-based Ride Entertainment Group, who currently handles all of coaster manufacturer Gerstlauer's operations in the Western Hemisphere. The Union Ironworkers construction crew completed ride construction in a record 11 days time, finishing on February 16, 2018, which would lead to the process being declared as a world record for the fastest construction timeline on a major coaster. On February 15, 2018, Oaks revealed that the new name of the coaster would be Adrenaline Peak. The name was submitted by William Phillips of Clackamas County, Oregon, who was rewarded with a $500 park gift card.

Unlike previous Arrow installations, this one would be more heavily-themed and produce an ""out-of-control feeling"" inspired by scenes from the 1984 film Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. Construction began later that year, and the total cost to build the family ride was estimated at $4 million. The ride was marketed as a jungle adventure mine train that plunges ""through steamy volcanic tunnels, across rickety bridges, and into a deserted mine shaft inhabited by snakes and spiders"". The roller coaster opened on April 13, 1991.

It would break the record for height and speed among inverted roller coasters, and it would feature the tallest vertical loop on an inverted coaster. The ride would be the park's second new roller coaster in two years after Wild Maus. It would be built in the deepest ravine, with much of it hidden by trees. Park experts had worked on state-of-the-art devices to keep the noise lower, including switching from nylon wheels to quieter polyurethane wheels and pointing the major drop away from residential neighborhoods in Kingsmill.Construction of Alpengeist began two months before the announcement in June 1996. The coaster would be made out of 106 track pieces, with seven for the lift hill, ten for the station and 89 for the rest of the layout.Alpengeist officially opened on March 22, 1997. It held the record for tallest inverted coaster until the opening of Cedar Point's Wicked Twister in 2002. However, Alpengeist remained the world's tallest among complete-circuit inverted coasters. In 2021, it was surpassed again by Legendary Twin Dragon, an inverted shuttle coaster in China. Wicked Twister closed at the end of the 2021 season making Alpengeist the tallest inverted coaster in North America. Additionally, Alpengeist would hold the record for being the fastest inverted coaster until Volcano: The Blast Coaster at the nearby Kings Dominion surpassed it in 1998.In 2022, Alpengeist was repainted with light blue supports.",,6,"3 trains with 9 cars.

The roller coaster replaced the former Aquaman Splashdown attraction near the park entrance. Aquaman: Power Wave is considered one of the top 10 new roller coasters anticipated for the 2020 season according to USA Today. Construction of the new roller coaster started and finished in February 2020.Due to the growing concerns of the COVID-19 pandemic, Six Flags announced a suspension of operations across the company on March 13, 2020. This included all operations at Six Flags Over Texas, including the prep work for the new coaster. The park resumed operations on June 19, 2020, with Aquaman: Power Wave still fenced in for construction. Earlier in April 2020, Six Flags announced measures for the company to survive the coronavirus pandemic, including deferring capital projects across the company that was slated for the 2020 season. In December 2020, Six Flags Over Texas responded to a user on Twitter questioning the status of Aquaman: Power Wave. The park stated that the coaster would now open in 2022.On the 60th anniversary of the park (August 5, 2021), Six Flags Over Texas announced that Aquaman: Power Wave was going to be modified with a turntable station to accommodate two 20-passenger boats. Originally, when the roller coaster was announced, the ride was to feature just one boat and no turntable station.The park announced on all of its social media accounts a third delay to the roller coaster, setting the new ride to open for the 2023 season. Citing the effects of supply chain issues and labor shortages, help caused for the delay.Six Flags Over Texas announced on February 15, 2023, that the roller coaster would open the following month on March 11. The park soft opened Aquaman: Power Wave two weeks before the set opening day of the roller coaster for season pass holders.Not long after opening, the ride received new two-way lockers, in which a door swings open on one side to insert belongings, and then swings open on the other side as guests exit the ride to retrieve them.",,,2 trains with a single car.

The anchor attractions were scheduled to include a roller coaster, as well as a new shopping area and a fountain, built at a cost of $150 million. The new coaster was planned to be a hypercoaster, over 200 feet (61 m) tall, which required approval from the Federal Aviation Administration. According to the filing with the FAA, the coaster was to be, at most, 220 feet (67 m) above ground level. The FAA approved the ride.In July 2019, Hersheypark officials announced that the new roller coaster would be called Candymonium, marketed as the ""world’s sweetest coaster"". According to Hershey Entertainment and Resorts Company CEO John Lawn, ""the coaster was a key ingredient to the entire Hershey’s Chocolatetown"". By that time, the first few track pieces and part of the station had been built.In an Instagram post in October 2019, Hersheypark posted an image showing that construction on the lift hill was partially complete. In November 2019, Candymonium topped out when its lift hill was installed. The final track piece was installed in February 2020, though an opening date had not been announced at that time. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Pennsylvania, construction on Chocolatetown was delayed in April 2020, though construction resumed the next month and the first test train on Candymonium ran on May 6, 2020. Candymonium officially opened on July 3, 2020. Because of COVID-19 restrictions, only a limited number of guests were initially allowed in the park, and riders had to wear face masks while waiting for the ride (although they could take off their masks on the coaster).",,0,3 trains with 7 cars.

In 1985, Canobie Lake Park purchased the ride. It lay unassembled for nearly two years, because if erected it would stand taller than the town of Salem would have allowed. In 1987, Salem gave Canobie Lake Park a waiver to put up the roller coaster. It was then renamed Canobie Corkscrew.
In August 2012, Canobie Corkscrew underwent a repainting. The coaster's support systems were painted white and the track itself was painted blue. Previously, the ride was yellow with black supports.

It led passengers past models of rockets and emulated asteroids and the darkened hall was dimly lit with thousands of tiny spots of light resembling stars. Due to the construction of neighbouring Wuze Town in 2001, the roller coaster was redeveloped with a fantasy jungle theme and renamed Temple of the Night Hawk. The coaster is now completely dark. Until 2006 there were green moving lights and strobe lights in the first lift hill, which are still present today but not operational. In 2008, the lights on the coaster trains were turned off or broken down and have not been repaired. 
Till 2010, there was a green laser projection with the outlines of a flying hawk, and until June 2012, there were red strobe-lights at the final brake run. In 2011, the park installed new strobe lights in the first lift hill, which broke down after about two months, and never repaired. 
The ride has four trains and one spare train for repairs, each with seven cars. Each car has two rows of seats, each holding two people. During the four-minute ride, the trains are lifted by three lift hill chains covering 1.174 metres (3 ft 10.2 in) of track. The roller coaster is therefore one of the longest indoor roller coasters in the world, slightly beaten by Mindbender in Galaxyland Amusement Park, Canada. The building containing the track is around 120,000 cubic metres (4,200,000 cu ft); it rests on 180 concrete pillars buried 12 metres (39 ft) deep in the ground. The building's basement level contains the ‘'Hollywood Tour’' dark ride. The total investment for the ride was around 15 million DM.
With the redevelopment of the ride in 2001, the park tried greening the roof of the hall by installing an irrigation system, but the results were not as good as expected. As an interim solution camouflage nets were installed on the roof, which, however, were removed after the major fire in the park and the resulting stringent fire regulations.
Until 2014, the song ""The Egg Travels"" from Disney's Dinosaur was played by several speakers placed inside the hall. In the station of the roller coaster, the song ""Inner Sanctum/The Nesting Grounds"" and the intro of the song ""The End Of Our Island"" from Disney's Dinosaur were played. By 2015 these songs were replaced with custom songs produced by IMAscore.Originally, the coaster was about to be manufactured by BHS/Zierer, with linear induction motors as transport elements. After the track layout was already developed and models were created, the park finally decided to work with Vekoma and scrap the idea of linear induction motors, because of financial reasons.

The idea had been three years in the making and Tivoli had held a procurement involving four roller coaster manufactures, with Bolliger & Mabillard being chosen to build the new roller coaster. With a total cost of 75 million DKK (€10 million), the attraction was at the time Tivoli's biggest investment in modern times, and the most expensive roller coaster in Denmark. It was named Dæmonen in January 2004.Slangen, Tivoli Gardens's family roller coaster, closed on 21 September 2003 to make room for Dæmonen. Once the roller coaster was demolished, construction for the new roller coaster commenced. By the beginning of December, most of the brake run and station portions of the track were erected. By the new year, the lift hill was topped off. The first drop was completed by the end of January 2004 and the last piece of track was placed in February. It opened on 16 April that year, and was sponsored by Mazda for its first three years in operation.On 14 July 2007, Dæmonen got stuck during a ride, and the passengers would have to wait an hour before they could be released by the fire department. On 20 July 2008, the ride stopped 25 meters above the ground, and 24 passengers were evacuated via built-in stairs. The latter incident was caused by a loose connection in an electronic sensor, which triggered the emergency brakes.On 6 April 2017 an optional, up-charge virtual reality experience was added to the ride.

These were a smaller, more family scale rollercoaster, 2 racing coasters, and 2 dueling coasters, the tallest out of all of them, as the other three shared the same lower height. In 1999 the two taller dueling tracks were combined at the end of the ride to create one exceptionally long track with two lift hills. This also made it a Quasi Möbius Loop.  This effectively doubled the length of the ride. What remains in dispute is whether this actually qualified as one long coaster or back-to-back rides on the same coaster. The three other coasters were removed when this conversion happened, with the majority of their supports remaining until the whole coaster’s demolition.","December 9, 2007",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The park demolished its long-standing Drive-in theater building in the spring of 2010 and removed its indoor Eli Bridge Scrambler ""Shake Rattle and Roll"" in the fall of that year. Also, the park's former Freefall attraction, a first-generation Intamin freefall tower, was located adjacent to the theater until it was removed after the 2006 season. The park added a construction blog to follow the construction of the roller coaster. In December 2010, Six Flags Over Georgia released a CGI video of Dare Devil Dive, showcasing the ride's layout and theming.The ride officially opened to the public on May 28, 2011, with soft opening for Season Passholders held the day prior. It was the second Gerstlauer Euro-Fighter to open in the Southeastern United States, with the first one being Mystery Mine at Dollywood.Six Flags announced on March 3, 2016, that Dare Devil Dive would be among several rides at various parks that would receive a virtual reality (VR) upgrade. Riders aged 13 and older will have the option to wear Samsung Gear VR headsets, powered by Oculus, to create a 360-degree, 3D experience while riding. The illusion is themed to a fighter jet, where riders fly through a futuristic city as co-pilots battling alien invaders. The feature debuted with the coaster when the park opened for the 2016 season on March 12, 2016.  Children 12 or younger will not be able to wear the headsets, and will have to ride Dare Devil Dive normally.

In March 2017, construction blueprints were published about the roller coasters layout and station, and construction began in April. In late-May 2017, the park sent out email teasers to its guests indicating a new ride was going to be announced with varying quotes alongside a 3D rendered track. In the forthcoming weeks on 4 June 2017, the park formally announced the roller coaster as 'DC Rivals HyperCoaster' which was initially scheduled to be opened in October 2017 and would be themed to the DC Universe.In July 2017, it was reported that the ride cost the park A$30 million to build. On 4 August 2017, the final piece of track was put into place, with testing beginning later on 19 August. On 11 September 2017, Warner Bros. Movie World launched advertisements for the ride, one in the form of an online website about the ride's statistics and another in the form of a television advertisement centred around characters from the DC Universe. Around this time, it was initially detailed by the Gold Coast Bulletin that the ride would be formally launched on 21 September 2017 during a VIP event. On 16 September 2017, the ride soft-opened to the public for technical rehearsals, and officially opened on 22 September 2017.Shortly thereafter, in October 2017 Warner Bros. Movie World reported that the ride had made 6.9 million impressions through media coverage and 9.3 million impressions through social media. In addition, the opening day brought in 11,500 visitors to the park as a whole.

Following land clearing taking place throughout the winter, it was reported in February 2018 that Dollywood officials were meeting with members of the Pigeon Forge Planning Commission in order to discuss the development of a 5-acre plot of land located between the Thunderhead coaster and the parking lot. In March 2018, plans submitted to the Planning Commission were uncovered and broadcast online, showing off a family-intended park expansion, which included several flat rides and an inverted coaster, which was quickly deduced to be the 453m variant of the popular Dutch firm Vekoma's Suspended Family Coaster model.With land clearing completed, early construction began on the new area, with footers being poured of the then-unknown Dragonflier coaster in July 2018. Amid several teasers, the name and logo of the new area, Wildwood Grove, became public knowledge on July 24, and the park subsequently set an announcement date for August 3, 2018. On the said date, Dragonflier was formally announced by Dolly Parton and park staff as part of the $37,000,000 Wildwood Grove, which would offer several new rides and amenities, as well as their first expansion to the park's footprint since 2008.After track began arriving in September 2018, Dragonflier quickly went vertical and was mostly constructed during the fall, with 85% of the layout reportedly having been completed by late November 2018. By 2019, the track was completed, and work would continue throughout the winter on the surrounding area and station in order to meet the anticipated May 2019 opening.

At the time Dreamworld stated that the ride would be closed temporarily to ensure the safety of all guests. In 2010, Dreamworld stated that the closure of the ride ""basically came down to new ride technology, upgraded safety regulations and responding to what the public wanted. Like the old Thunderbolt Rollercoaster, the mine ride served us well for 25 years and was ""retired..."" to make way for newer computerised attractions like The Claw, The Motorcoaster and AVPX. In Summary - rides have a life span - like a car - it comes to a time when you need to spend a lot of $$ to fix it up so when it is no longer a very popular attraction sometimes it is better to invest in something newer......

Consensus published by the park indicated they wanted water rides and roller coasters. In August 2011, the Orlando Sentinel revealed that the park had contacted at least three roller coaster manufacturers. In November 2011, it was confirmed that the park would receive two roller coasters: one wood and one steel. The coaster soft-opened in May 2013.During the 2015 International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions (IAAPA) Trade Show in Orlando, the Freedom Flyer was used to demonstrate Virtual Reality Technology on roller coasters.

In a closed-session meeting, it was mentioned that the roller coaster would stand 70 feet (21 m) higher than the park's Thunder Striker roller coaster which stands at 232 feet (71 m), meaning the new coaster would be 302 feet (92 m) high. On October 18, January 23, 2014, and June 9, Cedar Fair Entertainment Company, the owners of Carowinds, filed trademark applications for the names Centurion, Fury, and Fury 325. In February, the Centurion trademark was suspended after another trademark application using the same name was found by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. In July, the blueprints for Fury 325 were leaked showing the exact layout of the roller coaster. At the beginning of August, the park sent a beekeeper to deliver a partially burnt bug net with a card saying, ""you're gonna need a much bigger net to capture the thrills of the 2015 Carowinds season"", to several media outlets in the Charlotte area. On August 12, a microsite on Carowinds' website was found advertising a new ride called Centurion. A similar hoax was conducted by Kings Island leading up to the announcement of Banshee in 2013.Carowinds officially announced Fury 325 on August 22, 2014, at an event held at the park's Harmony Hall Marketplace. The first piece of track was installed on September 29, 2014. Within the week, the structure for the storage track was erected. By October 22, the majority of the brake run was complete; two days later the final pieces for the section were put into place. By October 26, the base of the lift hill was installed. On December 4, the lift hill and first drop were completed.  On January 30, 2015, the final piece of Fury 325's track was put in place. Fury 325 completed its first test run on March 4, 2015. On March 25, Carowinds held the coaster's media day. The ride officially debuted three days later on March 28, 2015, when Carowinds' 2015 operating season began.The ride closed on June 30, 2023, after a bystander spotted and reported a large crack at the top of a steel support pillar. The North Carolina Department of Labor launched an investigation, and Fury 325 was closed for repairs. Carowinds commented on July 6, after an inspection by park staff and the manufacturer, that the crack occurred on the weld line of the column. In addition to the regular inspections, Carowinds planned to implement further types of inspections on the roller coaster; a North Carolina labor commissioner said the crack had likely been visible at least a week before the ride was closed. After a new support was installed in mid-July 2023, the roller coaster reopened on August 10, 2023. The Department of Labor released documents to The Charlotte Observer on March 15, 2024 in response to a public records request made the previous summer.

Unlike Mantis, Chang and The Riddler's Revenge, which opened at Cedar Point in 1996, Six Flags Kentucky Kingdom in 1997 and Six Flags Magic Mountain in 1998 respectively, Georgia Scorcher did not continue the trend of the world's tallest and fastest stand-up roller coasters. Its layout is more modest, in fitting with the long, narrow site selected for it.
On November 10, 1998, Six Flags Over Georgia announced that they would be building a new stand-up roller coaster. It would be named Georgia Scorcher and was scheduled to open for 1999 season.Georgia Scorcher would open to guests in May 1999.

In October 1923, manager R.L. Cardiff and Walter Looff began negotiations to build a new ride to replace the Scenic Railway. The price was set at $50,000, $15,000 more than the Scenic Railway. In January 1924, the permit to build the Giant Dipper was granted to Arthur Looff. He wanted to create a ride that had ""the thrill of a plunge down a mine shaft, a balloon ascent, a parachute jump, airplane acrobatics, a cyclone, a toboggan ride, and a ship in a storm."" Demolition of the Scenic Railway began in January 1924 to make room for the Giant Dipper. It took 5 months to demolish the Scenic Railway and construct the Giant Dipper. The actual construction of the Giant Dipper took 47 days. The ride opened to the public for the first time on May 17, 1924.In 1974, the ride received a new coat of paint with Victorian-style architecture around the station. In the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, the Giant Dipper was practically untouched. The ride was closed for about a month to be inspected. The park held a benefit for victims of the earthquake. In 2002, the ride celebrated its 50 millionth rider. Ten years after the 50 millionth rider, the park celebrated the Giant Dipper's 60 millionth rider on July 27, 2012. The park gave out trivia coasters leading up to the event. The 24 riders that were on the train when it hit 60 million riders received a hoodie among other prizes.
The Giant Dipper was built by Arthur Looff and designed by Frederick Church. It required 327,000 feet (100,000 m) of lumber, 743,000 nails, and 24,000 bolts to construct. The lumber was provided by Homer T. Maynard Lumber, and the 70 horsepower motor, which is still used today, was provided by Santa Cruz Electric. The concrete was done by T.F. Costello, and the steel work was done by Berger and Carter.",,0,2 trains with 6 cars.

Plans were revived in 2012 when a permit was requested and approved to construct the new coaster in the northern half of the park. Construction began in May 2012, and the first pieces of lumber were delivered the following month in early June. On July 25, 2012, Cedar Fair Entertainment Company filed a trademark for the name Gold Striker. Vertical construction began in early August 2012. Gold Striker was officially announced on August 29, 2012. Representatives of the San Francisco 49ers were on hand at the ceremony, as the ride shares the same Gold Rush theme as the football team.On January 30, 2013, Gold Striker reached its first milestone as the ride's lift hill was completed. On February 20, 2013, California's Great America announced that the first drop would be fully enclosed, setting a world record for the longest drop tunnel on a wooden coaster. The park auctioned seats on the first six trains for Gold Striker. Members of the general public were invited to participate in an early riding session on April 30, 2013, during the park's promotional shoot. Gold Striker opened on May 31, 2013 and had an official opening ceremony the following day.
On July 1, 2013, Gold Striker was temporarily closed due to noise complaints. According to park management, the high thrill of the ride caused screaming passengers to slightly exceed city standards. Audio technicians had tested the sound levels at an office building located about 500 feet (150 m) away from the park at 4555 Great America Parkway and found them to be slightly above permitted levels. The attraction reopened on July 4, 2013 after a 70-foot (21 m) tunnel was added.",,0,2 trains with 12 cars.

Also on 17 September 2011, the DC Super Heroes Store opened adjacent to Batman Adventure: The Ride 2, Batwing Spaceshot and Green Lantern Coaster. By early October, most of the support structure and the lift hill were complete. By the end of October, the ride's construction was complete and work had begun on the entrance pathway. In early November, six trains arrived on site. Another was showcased by S&S Worldwide at the 2011 IAAPA Attractions Expo. Kevin Rohwer, an S&S Worldwide spokesman, stated that the ride would be ready on 15 December 2011. On 28 November 2011, testing began.

The area officially opened in the Islands of Adventure theme park on June 18, 2010. The Harry Potter-themed area saw attendance at Islands of Adventure rise by as much as 36% in 2010. According to Jason Garcia of the Orlando Sentinel, this led to resort executives pondering ""when to expand Wizarding World and how to keep business balanced between Islands and Universal Studios Florida"". In April 2011, Brady MacDonald of the Los Angeles Times speculated that an area expansion would include the addition of Diagon Alley and a Gringotts-themed dark ride in place of the Lost Continent themed area in the park.On December 6, 2011, Universal park officials confirmed that an expansion would take place and described it as ""significant"". The announcement was made four days after the park confirmed the removal of Jaws, a ride scheduled to close permanently on January 2, 2012. Demolition of the Jaws ride and the surrounding Amity area began soon after its closure. After the site was levelled, work began on land reclamation as well as the construction of a series of buildings, including a large show building for the Gringotts ride.Further details about the expansion were announced on May 8, 2013, confirming new feature attractions themed after Diagon Alley and London. On January 23, 2014, the name of the area's flagship attraction was revealed to be Harry Potter and the Escape from Gringotts. It was later described as a ""virtual reality roller coaster"" by Entertainment Weekly as additional details were released in May 2014. The new ride opened on July 8, 2014, alongside other attractions in the new Diagon Alley section of the park. The building housing the attraction features a 60-foot (18 m) dragon statue perched over the entrance that utilizes special effects to simulate the breathing of fire.

The coaster was originally called Ladybug for its ladybug shaped trains. The coaster was located in the vicinity of the Giant Wheel from 1981 to 1988. It was later moved to Adventure Land for Kids (created in 1988) where it was renamed Nessie the Dreamy Dragon to fit with the dragon theming of that area. Then, it was moved near Mind Eraser in an area called Tiny Trio which featured two other rides called BMX Motocross (relocated to Elitch Gardens as Trike Bikes) and Dodgems (now known as Raccoon Rally).
The ride cars were green with yellow seats (prior to that the cars were red) and the track was black until it was moved to its new location and renamed in 1997. The ride from 1997 to 2011 had a red track with teal supports and a single light blue train with red seats. This color scheme is similar to the nearby Mind Eraser, an inverted roller coaster built by Vekoma in 1997. The ride now has a sea green track and supports, and a single brown train themed as an owl.
For the 2012 season, Darien Lake rethemed their kid's section to Rowdy's Ridge which included several new rides (Hornet's Nest, Moose on the Loose, and Rowdy's Heave Ho) and changes to two rides (Brain Teaser became Hoot N Holler and Dodgems became Raccoon Rally).",,0,,,,,,36 in (91 cm),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The following month, Six Flags announced that, to reduce its financial losses during the pandemic, it would defer numerous capital projects that had been scheduled for its parks during the 2020 season. Although Six Flags Great Adventure resumed operations on July 3, 2020, the park announced in June that the opening of the Jersey Devil Coaster had been delayed to the 2021 season. Many parts for the roller coaster were delayed because of manufacturing slowdowns caused by the pandemic.The park resumed construction on the coaster in late December 2020. The following month, on January 25, 2021, the final piece of track was installed at a topping out ceremony. The roller coaster's chain lift, ride controls, and trains had yet to be installed at the time, and Six Flags also had to obtain permits from New Jersey government officials. Six Flags Great Adventure conducted its first test runs in late May 2021, simulating the weights of passengers using water-filled dummies. The ride was formally opened to the public on June 13, 2021, following a preview event for the media on June 10.

As planned, the Kentucky Flyer junior wooden coaster was announced on September 21, 2018, with a planned 2019 opening date. This would be a family-sized wooden coaster from Cincinnati-based Gravitykraft Corporation, with plane-themed trains and a top speed of 35 mph (56 km/h).Construction on Kentucky Flyer began soon after, but was quickly halted in mid-October by the park's landlord, the Kentucky State Fair Board, who stopped the park from preceding with any kind of work and payments done on the ride, placing the ride's future in jeopardy. In an October 16 press conference on the construction site, park CEO Ed Hart claimed that the Fair Board was withholding access in an attempt to strong-arm the park into dropping a lawsuit over breaking a paid parking lease, instead giving rented spots out to Kentucky State Fair vendors. The following day, after Governor Matt Bevin and his administration became involved, the Fair Board changed course and once again granted permission for the park to continue onwards, securing Kentucky Flyer's future.In November 2018, Kentucky Flyer's plane-themed lead car was put on display at the IAAPA 2018 Expo in Orlando, Florida. Foundations would continue to be poured during that time, and the coaster structure would go vertical on November 30, 2018. Work would continue throughout the winter and be completed in late March to early April 2019. On April 12, 2019, Kentucky Flyer reportedly began testing trains on the layout, and the coaster opened to the public later that month, on April 28.",,0,2 trains with 6 cars.

This announcement occurred at an event held for roller coaster enthusiasts and the media. The event revealed the park's goal to build ""the tallest and fastest roller coaster on earth"", reaching 456 feet (139 m) and accelerating up to 128 miles per hour (206 km/h) in 3.5 seconds. The ride would be part of the Golden Kingdom, an 11-acre (4.5 ha) themed area being developed at Six Flags Great Adventure. Six Flags CEO Kieran Burke said: ""This is the first step in a process of really transforming Six Flags Great Adventure from the largest regional theme park in the world to a true regional destination.""

Intamin subcontracted Stakotra to assist with construction. On January 13, 2005, workers completed Kingda Ka's tower with a topping out ceremony. For the ceremony, one 50-story crane was used to hoist two workers to the top of the ride; another crane lifted a 9,000-pound (4,100 kg) steel beam, with an American flag, to the ride's pinnacle. The ride was still under construction when the park opened for the season in March 2005. The attraction was originally scheduled to open on April 23, 2005, but its opening was delayed to May 21, as the park stated that more time was needed to complete testing. A media event was held two days prior on May 19, 2005.Upon its opening, Kingda Ka became the tallest and fastest roller coaster in the world, taking both world records from Top Thrill Dragster at Cedar Point. Intamin designed both Kingda Ka and Top Thrill Dragster, and the two share a similar design and layout that differs primarily by the theme and the additional hill featured on Kingda Ka. Both rides were built by Stakotra and installed by Martin & Vleminckx. Though Kingda Ka was popular among both the general public and roller coaster enthusiasts, its use of relatively new technology meant that Six Flags Great Adventure had to hire a dedicated maintenance team for the ride. Because of maintenance issues, the ride was closed for almost two months during its first season, and it was closed for an additional three weeks at the beginning of the 2006 season. Kingda Ka continued to be the world's fastest coaster until Formula Rossa at Ferrari World opened in November 2010.On August 29, 2013, Six Flags Great Adventure officially announced Zumanjaro: Drop of Doom for the 2014 season. The new attraction was attached to the Kingda Ka coaster. The drop tower features three gondolas integrated into the existing structure which was also built by Intamin. Kingda Ka closed at the start of the 2014 season in order to construct Zumanjaro: Drop of Doom on to Kingda Ka. Kingda Ka reopened on weekends on Memorial Day Weekend and fully reopened when Zumanjaro: Drop of Doom was completed on July 4, 2014.",,0,"4 trains with 5 cars each.

The announcement also listed a major new steel coaster as the star investment of 2021, with early artwork showcasing an out-and-back mega coaster located near the upcoming Tiki-Waka.Walibi officials shortlisted three major European suppliers for the project, eventually contracting Intamin to build the coaster following the 2017 annual IAAPA Berlin expo. At the 2018, annual IAAPA Orlando expo, Intamin and park operator Compagnie des Alpes formally unveiled two new coaster projects in a joint announcement; the then-unnamed Toutatis at Parc Astérix and the mega coaster for Walibi Belgium, which was confirmed once again to be debuting in 2021. The Walibi coaster layout was unveiled in full detail, and was confirmed to debut with a top height of 164 feet (50 m) and a top speed of 70.2 mph (113.0 km/h), making it the tallest and fastest coaster in the Benelux region upon opening (beating Goliath at Walibi Holland for height and Fury at Bobbejaanland for speed). It would also feature a total track length of 3,937 feet (1,200 m) and two world's-first elements; a wall stall and a non-inverting cobra roll. Kondaa opened to the public on May 8, 2021.In August 2019, land clearing began on the site, indicating that construction was due to start shortly. An existing building behind the park was also razed in early 2020. Following the construction of the station, the coaster went vertical in July 2020, with track being installed at a rapid pace. The signature non-inverted cobra roll and the ride's tallest lift hill were topped off and completed in early August, with the ride layout being completed the following month. Thematic work would begin to take shape around the area, and in late November the ride's then-unannounced name was divulged from the newly constructed entrance sign; Kondaa. This was later confirmed by Walibi themselves.
On December 17, 2020, Kondaa passed its first full-circuit test run, and Walibi soon began releasing teasers on their YouTube channel. Kondaa's first onride POV was released on May 5, 2021, and following an easing of COVID-19 restrictions, the park made plans to debut the ride on May 8, 2021.

During interviews in 2014, following up on the debut of the Mack Rides creation Alpina Blitz, project manager Rodolphe Gélis once again expressed the park's interest in a major new water attraction if attendance figures stayed profitable.The water coaster began development in 2017, following the opening of the Extreme Dungeon drop tower the year before. The attraction was developed over the course of two years, with park officials deciding on a patch of land in between Alpina Blitz and the adjacent hotel. A Mack Rides Supersplash - similar to Europa Park's Atlantica SuperSplash - was initially sought after, but was dropped after ride engineers were unable to fit the bulky attraction into the limited plot of land, and a smaller-scale variant entered development. In order to accommodate the new attraction, the park's Grand Roue ferris wheel was dismantled after the 2019 season and relocated within the park to the site of the former Bobsleigh coaster.French forums Coastersworld.fr hosted a livestream on May 21, 2020, where they recapped a recent Planet Coaster competition; contestants had been tasked with designing a possible new coaster for Nigloland. During the stream, Rodolphe Gélis made an appearance to give the first official confirmation of a new coaster project, which would open for the 2021 season. A day earlier, on May 20, the park had trademarked the name Krampus Expédition with the National Institute of Industrial Property, which remained uncovered by the public until several months later. Construction of the ride progressed throughout the 2020 season, and the coaster track began to arrive in the fall. The first pieces of track were placed in October 2020, and the coaster portion was completed on November 27, 2020.In a fall 2020 interview with local park fanbase Niglofans, Rodolphe Gélis confirmed the addition of Krampus Expédition and released various technical aspects and details about the attraction. Following a number of teasers, Krampus Expédition was formally announced by Nigloland on December 10, 2020, as France's first water coaster and the park's largest investment to date at €12,000,000. The coaster made its first test runs on February 20, 2021. Krampus Expédition officially opened to the public on June 12, 2021.",,0,6 trains with a single car.

In August 2012, Ed Hart returned to the Fair Board with a new proposal which included a US$15 million Bolliger & Mabillard roller coaster, but the plans were slightly changed to a US$7 million roller coaster and a different manufacturer.

Dick Kinzel took over as president and CEO of Cedar Fair, the company that operates the park, in 1986. In 1988, Kinzel saw a report on CNN about the opening of a new coaster in Japan called Bandit at Yomiuriland that emphasized height and speed but had no inversions. Kinzel wanted to introduce a similar coaster that emphasized steep drops and negative g-forces over inversions and spins, which were common at the time. It had been 10 years since the last major addition, Gemini, was introduced. Cedar Point asked for proposals from TOGO, Dinn Corporation, Intamin and Arrow Dynamics to build a roller coaster without inversions or over-the-shoulder restraints. They chose Arrow, due to the weakness of the dollar at the time, which eliminated overseas production. Arrow was also working on the new Iron Dragon at the time. Arrow and Ron Toomer proposed a 187 feet (57 m)-tall coaster, to best the then-largest roller coaster drop on Shockwave at Six Flags Great America. That got Cedar Point's management interested in breaking the 200-foot (61 m) barrier, partly because of the publicity to be gained from building the first roller coaster to do so. The name Magnum XL-200 was chosen because Magnum, P.I. was popular at the time. ""XL"" and ""200"" were added for ""extra-long"" and standing at least 200 feet (61 m) tall, respectively. The original proposal was to cost $7.5 million, but was raised to $8 million after the height was extended to 200 feet (61 m). Funds from Cedar Fair going public on the New York Stock Exchange in April 1987 were used to fund the ride.",,0,3 trains with 6 cars.

Alongside this development, the park's classic Turnpike attraction, which was built in 1963 by Arrow Dynamics, was reconstructed along the perimeter of the Exploration Island. This was said to be doubled in length, rendering the original obsolete and leaving space in the centre of the park for future development.On October 24, 2016, the park began to release teasers that were soon connected to the addition of a new ride. On November 1, 2016, Merlin's Mayhem was officially announced, in the form of a high-flying family inverted coaster that would take guests on a quest to find Merlin's mischievous pet dragon Mayhem. Built on the old Turnpike site, it would become the park's first coaster in nearly two decades as well as the largest and tallest ride in the park. Two weeks later, on November 16, 2016, the Merlin's Mayhem ride vehicle was revealed by the ride manufacturer, Utah-based S&S – Sansei Technologies, at the IAAPA 2016 Expo in Orlando, Florida.Track pieces would begin to arrive in April 2017, and the ride would go vertical soon after. Despite a fast construction pace, Merlin's Mayhem missed its projected summer opening, and on December 20, 2017, the park announced that the attraction's grand opening had been delayed to 2018. This was attributed to various construction setbacks and a longer-than-anticipated approval process, reportedly due to the coaster's interactions with the park's Sky Ride and other attractions. Following the delays, Merlin's Mayhem was officially opened to the public on April 28, 2018.",,0,Single train with 10 cars.

It was originally intended to be the centrepiece of a themed area called Frontier Canada, but the idea for the section was abandoned – the section was later built for the 2019 season.Minebuster is an out and back roller coaster designed by Curtis D. Summers and built in-house. The roller coaster was not built by PTC, despite a plaque at the operator's booth and several published reports that claim it was. PTC stopped building coasters in 1979. It is likely however, that the construction crew consisted of workers who had previously built coasters for PTC. The two, 30-passenger trains were supplied by the Philadelphia Toboggan Coasters.

In 1982, TOGO opened the Dangai coaster (then known as the Merry Dolphin) at the now-defunct Thrill Valley park in Gotemba, Shizuoka (which at the time went by the name Odakyu Gotemba Family Land). The coaster quickly incorporated a set of Togo's then-prototype stand-up trains, and that same year Yormuiriland also bought a standup train for the Standing and Loop Coaster. Since then, the roller coaster simultaneously operated both a standup and sit-down train with a modified sliding station. The success of these quickly attracted the interest of Ohio-based Kings Entertainment Company, who acquired a trio of standup coasters from Togo between 1984 and 1986; King Cobra at Kings Island, SkyRider at Canada's Wonderland, and Shockwave at Kings Dominion.In August 2021, Yomuiriland announced that the Momonga Standing and Loop Coaster would permanently close after 42 years of operation. Beginning on September 4, the park launched a last riders campaign, where free souvenirs were handed out to participants and a lottery held to determine the coaster's last official riders.

However, Muskrat Scrambler still remains at the closed amusement park with wooden coaster Mega Zeph, along with other attractions. The park has been closed since 2005 and is no longer a Six Flags park; it is now owned by the city of New Orleans. Despite Six Flags severing the park's lease in 2009, all Looney Tunes and DC Comics theming was kept intact.

The ride occupies a 1-acre (0.40 ha) expansion area of Timber Canyon near Thunderhead. According to Dollywood, Mystery Mine would feature state-of-the-art special effects, dark ride elements and mineshaft theming. For the ride system, the park hired Gerstlauer to build a custom variation of the Euro-Fighter coaster model — the first of its kind in the United States and the first to feature two vertical lift hills.Mystery Mine officially opened on April 13, 2007. It was one of the two Gerstlauer Euro-Fighters to open that year, with the other being Rage at Adventure Island in Essex, England.On March 9, 2021, photos were released which showed a change in the layout. Originally, the ride's first large drop was directly after the first block brake. The cars would pass under the first block brake, rise into a sharp vertical left U-turn, and then make a 270 degree right turn upwards into the second block brake. After the modifications, the ride now makes a 90 degree left turn before its first large drop, which leads directly into a 180-degree right turn into the second block brake."" This new first drop has a trim brake and the former U-turn still remains unused. The rest of the layout remains the same, including the second half of the first outdoor portion and the climactic 95-degree drop and inversions. Mystery Mine became one of Dollywood's two roller coasters to receive new track in 2021, with the other being Lightning Rod.",,2,7 trains with a single car.

In the park's Rivertown section, a construction wall was built displaying signs that stated, ""Caution - Watch For Falling Trees"". In June 2016, a set of plans labeled ""Kings Island Project 2017"" was submitted to the Mason planning board with designs for a new roller coaster. Until then, early speculation from enthusiasts believed that another possibility was a larger log flume to complement the nearby Race For Your Life Charlie Brown attraction. Later that month, media outlets in the area received a toy axe with an attached note hinting about activity in Rivertown. The following month, another clue surfaced, consisting of a blue toy pickup truck with a bundle of logs in the back. It contained a note stating that an official announcement would occur in the park on the evening of July 28, 2016.On the night of the announcement, more than 1,000 park guests lined up two hours in advance to attend the evening event inside the park. It was revealed that the new attraction would be a roller coaster named Mystic Timbers. The new ride would mark the park's sixteenth roller coaster and fourth wooden roller coaster overall. Upon completion, Kings Island would reclaim the title of having the longest collection of wooden roller coaster track in the world at 18,804 feet (5,731 m), when combined with the other three wooden coasters in the park – The Beast, both tracks on The Racer, and Woodstock Express. This surpassed the current record, Six Flags Great America, which measured the length of Goliath, Viper, American Eagle and Little Dipper at 16,558 feet (5,047 m).
The ride's logo was unveiled as well, along with a simulated POV video of the ride. However, the simulation stopped short of revealing what happens when the train enters an enclosed shed near the end of the ride. Park officials indicated that the finale's details would not be revealed until opening day. The level of anticipation surrounding its debut put Mystic Timbers on USA Today's top nine list for most anticipated roller coasters of 2017.Vertical construction of Mystic Timbers began in August 2016. On March 20, 2017, the ride performed its first test runs. The attraction opened for the press on April 13, 2017, allowing roller coaster enthusiasts and members of the media to ride early.",,0,3 trains with 12 cars.

The growing size of Albuquerque, New Mexico, was a contributing factor in constructing the roller coaster; by the early 2000s, the nearby population had grown enough that a large addition to the park was feasible. In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, park co-owner Gary Hays brought forward the construction of its conceived roller coaster by a year to help in the recovery of tourism. Then-mayor of Albuquerque Martin Chávez assisted in facilitating permits for the park to build the roller coaster in 2002; in part, facing some opposition from city hall. Hays contracted Custom Coasters International (CCI) to manufacture and build the roller coaster in January 2002, based on their reputation and deals offered. A month later, groundbreaking and construction of the roller coaster began.Park owners Gary and Linda Hays, as well as Chávez, announced the construction of the roller coaster at the Albuquerque city hall on February 20, 2002. The unnamed wooden roller coaster would cost $2 million to construct and have a projected opening date for June 21. Park officials simultaneously announced a contest for the public to submit names through local Wendy's locations for the attraction. Park officials wanted to advertise the roller coaster to an adult demographic and would increase park admission prices. The construction of the roller coaster would result in ""15 to 30 jobs"" being added, with the park aiming for an increase in attendance for the 2003 season. Installation of concrete foundations began after the roller coaster's announcement.The contest ended in April 2002, with the name, ""New Mexico Rattler"", chosen from a 4-year-old's submission in May. The owners selected the name because of its likeness to the predator and state. In early May, steel supports began to be built, with construction of the wooden track taking place soon after. The roller coaster's anticipated opening date was set back in June due to construction delays; a new opening date scheduled for mid-July. A second set back to its opening date in July delayed the roller coaster's opening near the fall season, due to pending delivery of construction materials. In late July, manufacturer CCI filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, ending operation.At the time of the manufacturer's bankruptcy, the ""roller coaster was 95% finished"". Following CCI's closure, the park employed seventeen previous workers from manufacturer and another eight workers to finish the roller coaster. The delays caused additional costs to the $2 million initially slated for its construction, and the bankruptcy was partially attributed by industry experts to the amusement market decline. The roller coaster was removed from advertising that had been intended to promote it until it opened. Final test runs for the roller coaster were conducted on September 27, 2002, and it opened the next day, September 28.",,,Single train with 6 cars.

Summers as the designer. One would go to Six Flags Over Texas as The Texas Giant and the other would go to Six Flags Over Georgia as Georgia Cyclone.Construction had already started in June 1989. The Texas Giant was constructed using over 900,000 board feet (2,100 m3) of wood. The trains were manufactured by Philadelphia Toboggan Coasters. The Texas Giant officially opened on March 17, 1990. At opening, the ride was the world's tallest wooden roller coaster, standing 143 feet (44 m) high.Following the ride's opening it had several modifications and renovations, which included reprofiling parts of the ride, shortening the seven-car trains to six-car trains, and performing maintenance on the wooden track. Six Flags Over Texas performed over 1,200 feet (370 m) of trackwork on the ride in the 2008–2009 offseason, with the ultimate aim of improving the ride's smoothness. Although the maintenance did improve the ride, park officials needed a more permanent solution. Initial speculation indicated the ride would be removed entirely from the park; however, Six Flags Over Texas denied any intention or consideration to do so. In March 2009, the park announced the closure of Texas Giant prior to a $10 million renovation. Following Fright Fest for that year, the ride closed on November 1, 2009.
Renovations began almost immediately and involved the removal of all of the wooden track and modifications to some of the support structure. On March 3, 2010, Six Flags Over Texas and Rocky Mountain Construction (RMC) unveiled the steel I-Box track which would be used on the refurbished ride. The track was developed over the course of three years by RMC owner Fred Grubb, and Ride Centerline, LLC engineers Alan Schilke and Dody Bachtar. The steel track was designed to be a replacement for any existing wooden track structure, with the rail shape, approximate weight, and dimensions remaining the same. Schilke designed the modifications to the layout, giving specifications to Grubb for manufacturing at RMC's Idaho plant. There, two-dimensional plates of steel were machine-welded to form the three-dimensional track parts. The redevelopment saw much of the track get reprofiled; the lift hill was increased by 10 feet (3.0 m), the first drop was steepened to 79 degrees, and several overbanked turns (ranging from 90° to 115°) were added. In October 2010, Six Flags announced that the renovated ride would be called the New Texas Giant. It opened on April 22, 2011.",,0,3 trains with 6 cars.

This was ultimately never realized, but would be brought to light decades later.After 24 years of operation, on 27 August 2017, the Pavillon de Solido and its residing Explorarium IMAX theatre was permanently closed. The following month, in October 2017, Futuroscope manager Dominique Hummel announced the construction of the park's first full-fledged roller coaster, which was confirmed to be a themed experience and represent a solid €22,000,000, making it the park's largest investment since their inception in 1987. During late 2018/early 2019 the coaster began construction under the working title Mission Kepler, in reference to the Kepler space telescope or Kepler's laws of planetary motion. It was also confirmed to be a product from Liechtenstein-based firm Intamin, who had showcased renderings for similar attractions at the Euro Attractions Show (EAS) 2017.On 2 September 2019 Futuroscope formally announced the attraction, in the form of Objectif Mars (translation; Mission Mars), a family-friendly spinning coaster featuring a drop track and various effects. The park had previously considered several names for the ride, such as Mars Challenge, Mars G-Force, and Mars 2040; the resulting name was chosen from a vote on park owner Compagnie des Alpes's website.Objectif Mars was originally expected to open on 28 March 2020, but was delayed when the COVID-19 pandemic forced the park to shut down that month. Futuroscope was able to reopen three months later, on 13 June 2020, and Objectif Mars was finally able to open as well.",,0,4 trains with 3 cars.

Joel Manby, CEO of Herschend, wanted a ""world first"", to have a wooden roller coaster that would be ""the first to do a double barrel roll"", which is when the train goes twice through a combination of a loop and a roll.  In 2011, Rocky Mountain Construction showcased their new steel roller coaster, New Texas Giant, to park executives. This demonstration secured the contract.Marketing began in 2011 when the public were made aware at the 2011 trade show of the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions that Rocky Mountain were working on a wooden roller coaster; it being later revealed that this roller coaster would be built at Silver Dollar City. Following the beginning of construction at the park, Silver Dollar City launched a teaser website for a new attraction to open in 2013. The website featured a public notice indicating that the ride's theme would be stagecoaches and the wild west. The teaser website also stated that an announcement would be made on August 9, 2012. As part of its teaser campaign leading to the announcement, the park released two clues; the first clue was a handwritten letter, while the second was a photo of the park's Powder Keg: A Blast into the Wilderness attraction and the nearby Table Rock Lake. On August 9, 2012, Silver Dollar City officially announced that Outlaw Run would open in the second quarter of 2013. At its opening, the ride would be the only wooden roller coaster to feature inversions and would feature the steepest drop on a wooden roller coaster. At a cost of $10 million, the ride would be the most expensive Silver Dollar City attraction in more than a decade.On September 26, 2012, the last piece of track was installed on Outlaw Run. The ride opened to a limited audience on March 13, 2013, with a public opening two days later. Official opening celebrations were held in April.",,3,2 trains with 6 cars.

A year later, in December 2015, a public survey was launched by park operator Compagnie des Alpes on the website Loisirs Lab asking for a preference of one of three options being considered as a future project. The three projects listed were; Crocos, an Egyptian-themed Zamperla top spin; Le Vol de Thor, a Norse-themed Bolliger & Mabillard Flying roller coaster, and Pégase Express, a large Ancient Greece-themed Gerstlauer family coaster with similarities to the smash hit FireChaser Express at Dollywood. Ultimately, the latter project was the most favored, and plans moved ahead with such.Site preparation began in March 2016 in the Grèce Antique (Ancient Greece) section of the park, all but confirming that the Pégase Express concept was moving forwards, and track intended for the project was spotted at the Gerstlauer manufacturing plant in April. The coaster was officially confirmed by the park on July 4, 2016, and further details were released. Construction carried on through the fall and winter of 2016-2017, and the layout was completed around February-March 2017. Testing commenced in April 2017, while landscaping and station work wrapped up.

Faced with the challenge of finding the necessary space, the park settled on a design from Arrow Dynamics. The concept featured a 160-foot (49 m) lift hill with a record-breaking 228-foot (69 m) drop, surpassing the previous 194.7-foot (59.3 m) record set two years earlier by Magnum XL-200 at Cedar Point. With a top speed of 80 mph (130 km/h), it was also set to become the world's fastest. Kennywood unveiled plans for the new ride, dubbed Steel Phantom, on July 27, 1990. Steel Phantom was built on the former site of Laser Loop, a Shuttle Loop coaster removed after the 1990 season. It also reused the Laser Loop's loading station.
Construction of Steel Phantom began during Labor Day weekend in early September 1990. It was set to open on May 4, 1991, but this would be delayed. The ride opened on May 10, 1991, setting new records in drop height and speed, as well as featuring four inversions. While the coaster was well-received and ranked frequently in the top 10 according to Kennywood, riders often complained of neck strain and excessive headbanging. Shortly after its debut, engineers found that the train would reach speeds exceeding specifications. The ride was closed for over a week so trim brakes could be installed prior to the inversions where the injuries were occurring.
On March 5, 2000, Kennywood announced that they would dismantle Steel Phantom. A replacement for Steel Phantom was not announced at the time. ""Just about anything is on the table"" said Kennywood spokeswoman, Mary Lou Rosemeyer. After the decision to remove Steel Phantom was announced, the park started receiving complaints and emails about the decision. Kennywood ultimately decided to keep the roller coaster but make modifications to it. On August 10, 2000, Kennywood announced that Steel Phantom would be transformed into Phantom's Revenge for the 2001 season. After the ride closed on Labor Day weekend in 2000, Steel Phantom underwent extensive changes by D. H. Morgan Manufacturing, most notably the removal of all of its inversions. The modified coaster reopened as Phantom's Revenge on May 19, 2001. The coaster only operated with one train in its first season. In 2002, magnetic brakes were added to the ride so a second train could be used. Because of the modifications, both Morgan style and Arrow style track have been utilized.

The coaster was a vintage Miler Manufacturing wild mouse style attraction, which had opened in 1958 and was operated by Midway Amusements in Brisbane, Australia, before being sold to Adventure City in 1999. The attraction had been given a major refurbishment upon its purchase that saw the installation of modern hardware, but by the 2010s it had finally succumbed to old age and was shut, standing idle during 2013 before being dismantled. The park had actively begun looking for a replacement.On February 24, 2014, Rewind Racers was announced as the park's largest investment in two decades at a cost of $2 million USD, with a set opening date of summer 2014. The coaster would become the first family shuttle coaster in North America, and accommodate riders as short as 39"". This never came to be, and the coaster's opening was delayed to 2015, with construction beginning in September 2014. The attraction layout was completed by the end of the year, and station work progressed throughout early 2015. After months of landscaping, testing, and further preparation, Rewind Racers opened to the public on June 6, 2015.A shed structure with additional thematic elements was meant to be installed the year after Rewind Racer's opening; however, this didn't materialize until early 2020.",,0,Single train with 7 cars.

Planning for the new attraction began two and a half years before its opening. The park chose Setpoint's suspended roller coaster model based on a visit by Hershey executives to Carowinds, an amusement park in Charlotte, North Carolina, where the Flying Super Saturator was located. The park liked the concept of the suspended roller coaster, as it would appeal to a wider guest demographic, instead of trying to entice visitors through constructing taller or faster roller coasters as other theme parks were. The roller coaster was redesigned eight times throughout its planning process as to navigate around obstacles within the park and existing utilities.The park announced on August 8, 2001 that it would add a new roller coaster for the 2002 season. The attraction would incorporate elements of a water ride and a suspended roller coaster. The roller coaster would interact with the nearby Canyon River Rapids and park visitors through various water stations. Plans for the attraction were being finalized during the announcement with an expected opening date of May 2002. A contest was held to determine the roller coaster's name. Seven thousand entrants submitted 10,000 names; the park ultimately selected the name ""Roller Soaker"", which was announced at the roller coaster's groundbreaking ceremony.Construction of the Roller Soaker began in November 2001. The park planned to open the Roller Soaker the day after the majority of water rides opened for the season. A media day was hosted for the Roller Soaker on May 7, later opening to the general public on May 11 during the park's 95th operating season. Along with the roller coaster, the park constructed a gift shop, lockers, and restroom. In addition, the plaza included a children's area.Rumors of the Roller Soaker's sale began to spread when it was listed on the attraction e-commerce website ""Rides4U"" in August 2012. A park spokesperson later refuted the listing, stating another company inquired about obtaining the roller coaster but the park did not want to sell. The Roller Soaker closed on September 3. In December, the park announced that the Roller Soaker would be replaced after 10 years of operation. In the same month, Aycock Construction began demolishing the Roller Soaker, replacing it with a 5,000-square-foot (460 m2) sprayground for the 2013 season.

Over the years, the aging coaster - which was manufactured in 1969 and opened at the park in 1983 - had undergone numerous refurbishments in order to extend its lifetime, but recent evaluations of the attraction determined that it was simply too old to continue operating safely. The Flitzer had its final day of operation on September 30, 2018, although the park assured that a new coaster was among the plans laid out to replace it.
Preparation began in October 2018, when the Flitzer, Doo Wopper wild mouse coaster, and other attractions were dismantled. The Formula One Raceway, a dormant go-kart track that had closed in 2016 and was located underneath the pier, was also gutted. On January 10, 2019, Morey's Piers formally announced the Runaway Tram coaster as the Flitzer's replacement, which would debut in time for the park's 50th anniversary and require the reconfiguration of seven existing attractions, including the Doo Wopper. Part of the pier was removed and footers poured into the ground below in April 2019, on space formerly occupied by the Raceway. Runaway Tram began vertical construction shortly afterwards, and the coaster train arrived on May 8, 2019.Runaway Tram first began testing on June 17, 2019. The coaster was originally intended to open on July 2, 2019, in time for the 4th of July long weekend, but an unprecedentedly slow approval process delayed its opening. Once the state signed off on the attraction, Runaway Tram opened to the public on August 9, 2019.",,0,Single train with 10 cars.

The coaster did not have a name at the time of its announcement, but the park eventually decided on the name ""Sky Rocket"", after its ride model. To make space for Sky Rocket, Kennywood retired the Turnpike, an electric antique car ride that had operated at the park since 1966. The Turnpike closed on August 16, 2009 and its cars were placed in storage with the intent that the ride be re-installed in the future, but as of 2023, this has yet to happen.  
The coaster's track arrived at the park in January 2010. Construction of Sky Rocket was completed in the spring of 2010. The ride opened exclusively to media personnel on June 28, 2010 before officially opening to the public the following day. 
For the 2017 season, riders were given the option of using a virtual reality headset when riding for a nominal fee of $5.Due to damages caused by an electrical fire in the ride's engine room in May 2018, the ride was not open for the majority of the 2018 season. Park maintenance confirmed that the generator had been damaged beyond repair and were waiting on a new one being manufactured overseas. They also said they did not have an estimated date for reopening the ride at the time. The ride re-opened on July 14, 2019, after Kennywood announced via a Facebook video that the Sky Rocket would once again be open to riders.",,3,2 trains with 2 cars.

Although Hershey executives preferred a proposal by Swiss manufacturer Intamin, the plan would cost twice as much as Fahrenheit, a $12 million coaster that opened in 2008. Intamin influenced Hersheypark officials to build another attraction in the low-lying Hollow section of the park. On August 17, 2010, Hershey Entertainment presented plans to Derry Township officials for a new attraction reaching 212 ft (65 m) tall. The ride's construction required a zoning variance because it exceeded the township's 200 ft (61 m) height limit. Hersheypark officials also proposed erecting 32 supports inside an artificial pond and removing two dining structures in the Hollow, although they refused to provide further details about the new ride.Hersheypark launched a marketing campaign, Attraction 2012, to promote what eventually became Skyrush. The Patriot-News wrote that the campaign included ""fake Web pages, hidden messages, foreign languages and symbolism"". Although Hersheypark publicly divulged little about the new ride, Attraction 2012 prompted extensive discussion on social media. Park officials submitted blueprints to Derry Township officials in April 2011, indicating that a roller coaster with a winding layout would be built in the Hollow section of Hersheypark. Work on the coaster had begun in early 2011, when workers began diverting Spring Creek, allowing the ride's concrete supports to be constructed. By June 2011, pieces for the as-yet-unnamed attraction had arrived on site. In conjunction with the Attraction 2012 campaign, Hershey Entertainment filed a trademark for the name ""Skyrush"" by July 2011.The ride was officially announced on August 2, 2011. Skyrush was to be the first new roller coaster at Hersheypark since Fahrenheit in 2008. Skyrush was built on the site of the Sunken Gardens, a portion of Hersheypark that had not been open to the public since 1972. The Sunken Gardens was redesigned when Skyrush was constructed. The site was flooded in September 2011 during Tropical Storm Lee, which forced workers to remove and reinstall all of the concrete footings; this delayed construction by three weeks. The retaining walls along Spring Creek were rebuilt in conjunction with the Skyrush project, and the area received new landscaping. Because of a relatively mild winter in late 2011 and early 2012, construction crews were able to complete the ride before its scheduled opening on Memorial Day in 2012. The ride's construction employed up to 160 workers simultaneously.Skyrush opened to the general public on May 26, 2012. The ride cost $25 million and was the 12th roller coaster at Hersheypark, as well as the third coaster that Intamin built at the park (after Storm Runner and Fahrenheit). With Skyrush's completion, Hersheypark rebranded the surrounding section of the park from ""Comet Hollow"" to ""The Hollow"". Park officials anticipated that the ride's opening would cause the park's attendance to increase. Skyrush was one of three Wing Coasters to open in the United States in 2012, the others being Wild Eagle at Dollywood and X-Flight at Six Flags Great America. The three Wing Coasters were featured on a Good Morning America segment in June 2012. Skyrush was also Intamin's only Wing Coaster installation until 2016, when Flying Aces opened at Ferrari World Abu Dhabi.On February 29, 2024, Hersheypark announced via their Instagram account that Skyrush would be receiving an updated logo, new seats, and restraints, in place for opening day on March 29. In addition to the train upgrades, it will be opening with a ""reimagined"" station platform, lighting effects, and custom soundscape.",,0,2 trains with 8 cars.

The name was a pun on the song ""Pinball Wizard"" by The Who. In 2010, it was announced that Spinball Whizzer would be receiving a Sonic the Hedgehog re-brand as part of a partnership with Japanese video game company Sega. The roller coaster was therefore given a red and blue track repaint; new decoys, signage and audio, including songs from the games with the station announcements provided in-character by Roger Craig Smith as Sonic (prior to his official debut as the character in Sonic Free Riders). The ride re-opened to the public as Sonic Spinball on 13 February 2010 during the park's February half term event. A Sonic-themed room was also made available at the Alton Towers Hotel, which featured various playable Sonic games and wallpaper based on Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode I.Sega previously had a deal with Alton Towers for the Toyland Tours dark ride. A Sonic animatronic featured in one of the ride's scenes along with associated sound effects and music. However, the ride was closed for refurbishment in June 2005 to make way for Charlie and the Chocolate Factory: The Ride, and currently the Alton Towers Dungeons. Sega's sponsorship was set to end in 2013 as part of the three-year deal. At the end of 2013, the sponsorship was renewed, and continued until 2016.On 2 June 2015, the ride was temporarily closed, owing to an accident on The Smiler at Alton Towers. Sonic Spinball reopened on 15 June 2015.

The ride is based on the SpongeBob SquarePants episode ""Rock Bottom,"" and features a prominently placed statue of SpongeBob and Patrick riding an orange bus down a 90 degree angle while holding a glove over his head. Design and fabrication for the giant statue was handled by Tivolitoo, a company that Nickelodeon Experience Design often collaborates with.Mall of America and its Camp Snoopy theme park were built upon the former site of the Metropolitan Stadium, and a plaque was installed at the previous location of the stadium's home plate. This plaque was kept intact during the theme park's conversion to its Nickelodeon re-theming, and now sits outside the entrance of Rock Bottom Plunge.On June 23, 2016, the guests who rode in the attraction's 1 millionth coaster ride were given 1 million free rides to the theme park and were the inaugural inductees into the ""1 Million Ride Club.""A similarly structured Gerstlauer-produced Euro-Fighter rollercoaster, TMNT Shellraiser, opened at  American Dream Meadowland's Nickelodeon Universe theme park in 2019.

The roller coaster was designed with the park's layout in mind and would interact with several of the park's existing attractions. Steel Eel's design focused on height and speed. Park officials had sought to increase the frequency of visitors with the opening of the roller coaster. The addition of the Steel Eel also sought to appeal to a wider-family demographic. SeaWorld San Antonio announced on August 18, 1998, that it would add a new steel roller coaster, named Steel Eel. The roller coaster was touted as a ""hypercoaster"", with a planned opening date set for March 1999.The construction of Steel Eel was one of the many roller coasters announced by theme parks around the United States in a record high trend. Steel Eel was the most expensive single-season investment the park had made in a 10 year period. Testing rehearsals were finishing up in early March 1999.

Steel Taipan, then unnamed, was confirmed to be a near-clone of Mack's popular Blue Fire launched coaster model, except with a unique backwards portion and swing launch section as well as a spinning cart on the back row. The park had been able to secure the ride's hardware on a reduced timeline, as it was originally meant as a now-cancelled attraction at an unspecified Chinese park. Although a name had been undecided, two possible options had been trademarked during late November 2019; Hiss-teria and Steel Taipan.On March 19, 2020, park owner Ardent Leisure officially announced that they had established new financial measures to combat the then-emerging COVID-19 pandemic, which included freezing all non-essential costs. This included halting construction and thus indefinitely delaying Steel Taipan, removing it from its initial December 2020 target opening. Throughout the spring, supports and track would begin to arrive at the park, although very little groundwork had taken place by that point in time and construction had not yet started. Construction finally broke ground in late September, just after the park reopened from a COVID-induced shutdown.In late November 2020, Steel Taipan manufacturer Mack Rides unveiled their brand new HybridTrain spinning coaster car test concept just after the IAAPA annual convention, which was held virtually for 2020. Instead of the standard 4 seater spinning car, it would instead be a more agile 2 passenger car that could be more easily added onto existing and new launch coasters while abiding to tight clearances. The design also allowed for magnets in the seats to control the spinning speed. It was confirmed to debut on Steel Taipan, and a prototype had been tested on the similar Blue Fire launch coaster at Europa Park in Rust, Germany.In late November, Dreamworld formally announced the coaster's name to be Steel Taipan, as expected. Excavation and groundwork had also started to begin some time prior to that, after the park reopened, and Steel Taipan was on track for a late 2021 opening.Vertical construction of Steel Taipan began in April 2021 when the launch track was installed. In May, the vertical loop was completed. During this time, Dreamworld confirmed that Steel Taipan would feature a tunnel and mist effects. The twisted spike was then topped off in June. The track layout was then completed in August and testing began the following month. Steel Taipan had a soft opening on 10 December 2021 to a selected group of people. On 11 December 2021, the roller coaster opened to annual pass holders.

Hershey Entertainment and Resorts Company was considering one of three names for the coaster: Steel Stampede, Renegade, and Storm Runner. Hershey Entertainment hosted a contest in which members of the public could vote on the name. More than 46,000 people voted on the name over a two-week period. In November 2003, before the name was officially announced, Hershey Entertainment filed a trademark for the name ""Storm Runner"". Hershey Entertainment formally announced the coaster's name on November 5, 2003. Construction of Storm Runner began in February 2004 and ultimately cost $12.5 million. By April 2004, test runs for the coaster had commenced.Storm Runner first opened on May 8, 2004. The first people to ride the coaster included members of the Pennsylvania Army National Guard, as well as winners of an online lottery. Initially, the queue line would often be extended with ropes due to the ride's popularity. In 2005, the park added an overflow queue line located next to Trailblazer's first drop.
For the 2020 season, Storm Runner remained closed while waiting on necessary parts for maintenance and repairs that were delayed due to the global COVID-19 pandemic.

AstroWorld did not have a wooden roller coaster at the time, and the owners attempted to buy and move it to Houston.  After further study, the owners decided that a move would be prohibitively expensive, and so settled on building a replica of it.AstroWorld hired William Cobb to design the replica of the Cyclone.  He created a mirror image of it, which was also larger and faster than the original.  During its construction, which was done by the Frontier Construction Company, the north end turnaround was damaged by a tropical storm, which delayed its opening until 1976.  When it first opened, it was one of the tallest and fastest wooden coasters in the world. In 1979, the first turn was lowered by two feet to prevent stalling, so that it could operate safely in higher winds.
On July 29, 1983, an accident occurred in which one park employee was killed and several injured during a test run of the coaster. A new train was being added to increase ride capacity due to the large crowds. This process involves moving a section of track (transfer track) and manually moving a train from a storage/work area up into the station. The transfer track is moved back to the running position and the roller coaster capacity is doubled by running 2 trains. In this accident, the manager who took charge of the procedure forgot to move the track back into the running position. The train was loaded with employees and dispatched. The train went back through the storage shed, where it careened off the end of the work track killing an employee and injuring 14 others on the train. No one on the ground was injured.","October 30, 2005",0,6 cars.

Summers as the designer. One would go to Six Flags Over Texas as The Texas Giant and the other would go to Six Flags Over Georgia as Georgia Cyclone.Construction had already started in June 1989. The Texas Giant was constructed using over 900,000 board feet (2,100 m3) of wood. The trains were manufactured by Philadelphia Toboggan Coasters. The Texas Giant officially opened on March 17, 1990. At opening, the ride was the world's tallest wooden roller coaster, standing 143 feet (44 m) high.Following the ride's opening it had several modifications and renovations, which included reprofiling parts of the ride, shortening the seven-car trains to six-car trains, and performing maintenance on the wooden track. Six Flags Over Texas performed over 1,200 feet (370 m) of trackwork on the ride in the 2008–2009 offseason, with the ultimate aim of improving the ride's smoothness. Although the maintenance did improve the ride, park officials needed a more permanent solution. Initial speculation indicated the ride would be removed entirely from the park; however, Six Flags Over Texas denied any intention or consideration to do so. In March 2009, the park announced the closure of Texas Giant prior to a $10 million renovation. Following Fright Fest for that year, the ride closed on November 1, 2009.
Renovations began almost immediately and involved the removal of all of the wooden track and modifications to some of the support structure. On March 3, 2010, Six Flags Over Texas and Rocky Mountain Construction (RMC) unveiled the steel I-Box track which would be used on the refurbished ride. The track was developed over the course of three years by RMC owner Fred Grubb, and Ride Centerline, LLC engineers Alan Schilke and Dody Bachtar. The steel track was designed to be a replacement for any existing wooden track structure, with the rail shape, approximate weight, and dimensions remaining the same. Schilke designed the modifications to the layout, giving specifications to Grubb for manufacturing at RMC's Idaho plant. There, two-dimensional plates of steel were machine-welded to form the three-dimensional track parts. The redevelopment saw much of the track get reprofiled; the lift hill was increased by 10 feet (3.0 m), the first drop was steepened to 79 degrees, and several overbanked turns (ranging from 90° to 115°) were added. In October 2010, Six Flags announced that the renovated ride would be called the New Texas Giant. It opened on April 22, 2011.",,0,3 trains with 6 cars.

Track pieces first began to arrive at Carowinds on August 7, 2009. About three weeks later, on August 26, 2009, Carowinds officially announced Intimidator. Along with the announcement, Carowinds reached a licensing agreement with Dale Earnhardt, Inc. to use the late NASCAR racing legend Dale Earnhardt's brand as part of the ride. One of Earnhardt's sons, Kerry Earnhardt, was on-hand for the press conference announcing the attraction and endorsed the ride on behalf of the family.The first supports and track for Intimidator were installed on September 1, 2009. The lift hill was erected on October 1, 2009, and was completed on October 13, 2009. In order to install the last lift piece, 3 cranes were required. Construction on the roller coaster layout continued through November and December with the final track piece installed on December 21, 2009. Construction on the station, mechanics, and landscaping of Intimidator took place during the months of January and February. On February 4, 2010, testing of Intimidator commenced. The ride ultimately cost $23 million.On January 14, 2010, Carowinds launched a ""First Rider Auction"" in which people from anywhere in the world would bid to be one of Intimidator's first 96 public riders. The winners would ride the coaster on March 27, 2010, before it opened to general public; all money raised from the auction would go to the Dale Earnhardt Foundation. The highest bid for a single seat was US$500. The new roller coaster officially opened to the public on March 27, 2010. Intimidator was one of two roller coasters themed to Earnhardt that opened in 2010; the other was Intimidator 305, a giga coaster manufactured by Intamin at Kings Dominion, another Cedar Fair park. Carowinds officials hoped that the ride would attract guests.The licensing agreement to use the Intimidator nickname from the Earnhardt estate expired in December 2023. As a result, Intimidator was renamed Thunder Striker and the section of the park was named Thunder Road in recognition of the area's connection to stock car racing.",,0,3 trains with 8 cars.

Named Timber Drop, the coaster was inaugurated on 1 July 2011 and opened to the public the next day.
The coaster is an ""El Loco"" model, of which there are variants in five other parks. When Timber Drop was installed, two other El Loco coasters existed: One named Steel Hawg at Indiana Beach in the United States and another named Mumbo Jumbo at Flamingo Land Theme Park & Zoo in England. Steel Hawg (opened in 2008) and Mumbo Jumbo (opened in 2009) were holders of the world's steepest roller coaster drops of 111° and 112° respectively. Timber Drop had a steeper-than-vertical drop of 113.1°, which allowed it to win the title when opening. However, this record was exceeded fifteen days later, with the opening of Takabisha (121°) at Fuji-Q Highland in Japan on 16 July 2011.With a total budget of 4 million euros, Timber drop represented the largest investment in the park since its inception. More than one million euros is spent on decoration and arrangement of attraction, entrusted to the company Artistic Concrete Workshop. The theme of the attraction is that of redwoods. Trains and pass through several tree stumps during the run, various cut logs decorate the area surrounding the attraction.
Since its opening, a counter was set up on the attraction, to count the number of visitors riding Timber Drop. The park, in partnership with the association ""Trees for Life"" decided to educate visitors on the issue of deforestation. Fraispertuis City committed to donate money to replant and maintain one tree for every 500 riders. In 2011, the park has recorded 146,500 riders, which led to the replanting of 293 trees in Benin.

Built by the Gravity Group, Timber was constructed at a cost of €4.2 million and was well received by the public.
In 2019, the park began a three-phase renovation project on the coaster in which 85% of the track and structure would be replaced. In conduction with the Gravity Group, Phase's 1 and 2 took place during the 2018–19 and 2019-20 park offseason's, respectively. The third and final phase was originally planned to take place in the autumn of 2020, but was put on hold for a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Tonnerre 2 Zeus was officially announced by Parc Astérix on June 24, 2021, which would revitalize the coaster's image and conclude the renovations.

The area was themed as an archeological research facility, featuring similarly-themed restaurants and retail shops. The centerpiece attraction was announced as a new roller coaster called Tumbili, the expected 4D Free Spin model from S&S – Sansei Technologies. Vice President and General Manager Bridgette Bywater stated, ""Riders will want to ride Tumbili again and again because, depending on the weight, position and rider interaction, it provides a different ride experience every time.""The first pieces of track were erected in December 2021, and the final piece was installed on January 19, 2022. Testing of the coaster began in early March. Tumbili officially opened on March 12, 2022, although inclement weather and temperatures only allowed the coaster to dispatch two trains with riders before the park closed early for the day.",,0,Single car trains with riders arranged 4 across in 2 rows for a total of 8 riders per train,The Crypt,,,,48–77 in (122–196 cm),Official website,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Fast Lane available,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They hired Ohio-based International Amusement Devices (IAD), who began designing Colossus in January 1977. IAD in turn subcontracted Bernard Brothers Construction for the construction of the ride, Continental Consultants for all of the mechanical systems, and Lorenz & Williams for the structural engineering and electronic systems. A member of the design team traveled to Mexico City to study Montaña Rusa – the largest wooden roller coaster in the world at the time – in order to help plan for the project.The design was finalized in May 1977, and construction began a few months later in August. During construction, a tornado caused part of the structure to collapse, but the roller coaster was still completed on schedule. At a final cost of $7 million, Colossus opened to the public on June 29, 1978.

Movie World Germany opened with a dark ride named Gremlin Invasion, modelled after the Australian Warner Bros. Movie World's Warner Bros. Classics & Great Gremlins Adventure. On 3 April 2004, Warner Bros. Movie World Germany was acquired by StarParks. This acquisition resulted in various Warner Bros.-licensed properties being removed from the park including DC Comics, Gremlins and Looney Tunes. The following year, Movie Park Germany opened with Gremlin Invasion remaining closed.
On 17 May 2010, the park was acquired by Parques Reunidos. The former Gremlins show building and surrounding area was recognised by the park and its new owners as a negative part of Movie Park Germany. Due to the popularity of the park's Halloween events, Wouter Dekkers, Movie Park Germany's general manager, pitched the idea of a roller coaster with a horror theme to the new owners just one month after the acquisition. Parques Reunidos ultimately approved the ride, investing €5 million to design and build the ride. Within the month, a contract with German-based roller coaster firm Gerstlauer was signed. Movie Park Germany also worked with P&P Projects, Threshold Animation Studios and TAA Industries to develop the ride's storyline and theming.

Vonkaputous was built during the off-season 2000–2001 and opened on 12 May 2001, two weeks behind schedule. Total cost of the project was 22 million marks, which made Vonkaputous the most expensive ride investment in Linnanmäki's history at that time. Vonkaputous is the first Premier Rides roller coaster installed in Europe, and the second and last Liquid Coaster model to be built, alongside now-defunct Buzzsaw Falls at Silver Dollar City. Due to limited space, Vonkaputous did not have a free-floating river section but traveled on the track during the whole ride.
Like its counterpart in the US, Vonkaputous was repeatedly plagued with technical difficulties during its lifetime. For many years it was possible to operate the ride with only one car, despite having originally designed to have up to three cars running at the same time. This was mainly because of system glitches and the ride's interference-sensitive infrared sensors. Since it was not possible to operate Vonkaputous without water, there were two 160 kW pumps constantly circulating water when the ride was operating. Therefore the operational costs were high compared to the ride's capacity and the need for maintenance. Also, since Liquid Coaster is a discontinued model, limited spare part accessibility induced further problems.
In its last two seasons, the ride suffered from excessive downtime, and during its last season, Vonkaputous operated for only two months out of six months long season.

Park president Neal Thurman and West Coast Customs Founder and CEO Ryan Friedlinghaus announced their partnership in the design of the roller coaster, which was touted as having a record-breaking four magnetic launches. It would also feature four inversions – three zero-g rolls and one zero-g stall – along with 30 train interactions, which includes 14 track crossings and one ""high-five"" element across two laps around the course. The coaster would reach a maximum speed of 55 mph (89 km/h) and feature a number of airtime hills and overbanked turns that will occur side-by-side. West Coast Racers was originally marketed as the park's 20th coaster, but with the planned removal of Green Lantern: First Flight after the 2019 season, the park's total number of coasters remained at 19.Construction began months behind schedule in May 2019 following a delayed delivery of finished track. The first pieces arrived reportedly later than expected in February 2019. Six Flags did not release an expected opening date, but Theme Park Insider estimated fall 2019 based on the delayed start. A construction update in July 2019 showed a significant amount of work left to complete. In October 2019, a writer for USA Today said, ""Speaking of Magic Mountain, the Los Angeles-area park has not revealed anything new for 2020. It still has yet to debut West Coast Racers...""On December 12, 2019, it was announced West Coast Racers would operate during a series of preview events beginning on December 21, 2019.

The ride was the second full-sized roller coaster to open at the park since its re-opening in 1940, following the installation of Thunderbolt in 1941. The $2.5 million Riverside Cyclone was designed by William Cobb & Associates and built by the Frontier Construction Company. The ride officially opened to the public on June 25, 1983, with Cobb as well as Norm Howells from Frontier Construction in attendance. The opening of Riverside Cyclone was expected to increase park attendance by more than 10% to 1 million annual visitors.During its first season of operation, Riverside Cyclone featured two trains from Philadelphia Toboggan Coasters (PTC) where riders were restrained via a lap bar. Part-way through the first season, shoulder belts were added; however, these were removed prior to its second season. During its second season, the ride's trains were damaged, forcing the park to combine parts from both trains to form a single operational train. Two new replacement trains were purchased from D. H. Morgan Manufacturing in 1985.

In the late 1990s, Premier Parks (later Six Flags) purchased Riverside Amusement Park. Over a period of four years, approximately $100 million was invested in the renovation and expansion of the park, culminating in its rebranding to Six Flags New England in 2000. As a result, the Riverside branding was dropped, with the ride being renamed to the Cyclone. The D.H. Morgan Manufacturing trains were replaced with two PTC trains. The new operators made modifications to the track in 2001, shortening the first drop by between 15 and 20 feet (4.6 and 6.1 m).A refurbishment of the Cyclone in 2011 saw Topper Track from Rocky Mountain Construction added to sections of the ride. Topper Track is steel plating that replaces the upper layers of laminated wooden track. This track style is designed to reduce the maintenance typically required for a wooden roller coaster and provide a smoother ride experience.",,3,2 trains with 6 cars.

The new coaster was officially announced the following month, and its media day was held on May 2, 2002.Built as the tallest and fastest double-twisting impulse coaster ever built, Wicked Twister actually opened as the tallest and fastest inverted coaster in the world on May 5, 2002. It held both records until the opening of Legendary Twin Dragon at Chongqing Sunac Land in China in 2021. Additional supports were added to the ride's structure for the 2003 season. Two yellow supports were added to each spike to connect the track to the top of the main support structure.

In May 2021, park official Tony Clark implied in a series of tweets that Wicked Twister was going to be retired. This was confirmed on August 6, 2021, when Cedar Point officially announced the closure of Wicked Twister, scheduled for September 6, 2021. The ride then closed September 7, and on its last day of operation, park employees handed out ""last launch"" buttons to riders, sold limited-edition commemorative t-shirts, and gave away 16 ""golden tickets"" granting winners a spot on the last public train. Wicked Twister had accumulated over 16 million rides in 20 seasons of operation.On November 3, 2021, Cedar Point announced that Wicked Twister would be demolished. Demolition and removal was completed on February 8, 2022.After the closure of Wicked Twister, Cedar Point lost the record for most rollercoasters at any amusement park in the Cedar Fair chain to sister park Canada's Wonderland in Vaughan, Ontario.","September 7, 2021",0,Single train with 8 cars.

The ride was designed by Curtis D. Summers but is based on the original Coney Island Wildcat designed by Herbert Schmeck. It was constructed in-house under the direction of Summers. The coaster was not built by PTC despite a plaque at the operator's booth and several published reports that claim it was. PTC stopped building coasters in 1979. However, it is likely that the construction crew consisted of workers who had previously built coasters for PTC. The two 28-passenger trains were supplied by the Philadelphia Toboggan Coasters. Unlike the three-row PTC trains on Mighty Canadian Minebuster, Wilde Beast utilizes shorter two-row cars that are designed to better negotiate turns.
Curtis D. Summers continued to use this design at other Taft-owned parks including Kings Dominion in Virginia where the coaster, which opened in 1982, is known as Grizzly. Though similar in layout, the ride was tempered when reproduced as The Bush Beast at Wonderland Sydney in 1985 and at California's Great America as Grizzly in 1986.The coaster was featured in the Fraggle Rock episode ""The Thirty-Minute Work Week"", where Uncle Travelling Matt took a ride on it, as he mistook it for a form of transportation. Puppeteer Dave Goelz has a cameo in the scene as the man next to Matt.

It was designed by Sally Corporation and relies entirely on physical sets and theming rather than projected animations, and uses basic, moving props. About four years later, park management began discussing the addition of a new attraction inside Wonder Mountain. The technology available at the time meant the cost of building a more advanced dark ride was too expensive for a regional amusement park. In 2011, as technology improved and the costs decreased, the park started planning a second interactive dark ride. Several companies were contacted to design the audio-visual portion of the future ride; park management chose Triotech to do so.Speculation that Canada's Wonderland would build a new attraction for the 2014 season began at the end of July 2013 when maintenance work on the western side of Wonder Mountain was discovered. On August 8, Cedar Fair confirmed an interactive dark ride would be built at one of the company's parks. Wonderland officially announced Wonder Mountain's Guardian—a ten million-dollar attraction—on August 30, 2013, on Breakfast Television, a morning news program for the Toronto area. During the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions (IAAPA) Attractions Expo 2013, the characters of the ride were revealed during president and CEO of Cedar Fair Matt Ouimet's keynote address.The first pieces of track and other parts from Germany arrived at the park in mid-January 2014. A month later, installation of the track began inside the mountain. By the end of February, erection of the framing for the 3D screens began. By the beginning of March, support columns for the outside portion of the ride were installed. The lift hill was completed at the beginning of April. The park opened to the public on May 4 but the opening of Guardian was delayed. On May 24, the park announced that the ride had opened. The entire project involved 10 contractors and at least 47 workers.On November 7, 2013, Cedar Fair announced that during Halloween Haunt, Guardian would be altered to a zombie-themed ride.

The park hired Intamin to build and design a new roller coaster called Xcelerator, the company's first hydraulically-launched roller coaster, which uses pressurized oil and a series of hydraulic fluid chambers to rapidly propel a coaster train along a straight section of track. The total cost was $13 million. Intamin pioneered the hydraulic technology used on Xcelerator, which would later be built on a larger scale on future record-breaking rides, including Top Thrill Dragster at Cedar Point and Kingda Ka at Six Flags Great Adventure. The ride was originally scheduled to open in May 2002, but the opening was delayed to June 22, 2002.In May 2004, California investigators asked that Knott's Berry Farm temporarily close Xcelerator, and that the nearby Six Flags Magic Mountain close Superman: Escape from Krypton, because the T-bar restraint systems used by both rides were potentially defective. This was due to three incidents where people died after falling out of the restraints, including Superman – Ride of Steel at Six Flags New England. The rides were closed on June 2, 2004, so the necessary modifications could be made; Xcelerator reopened at the end of the month. After an incident in 2009, the ride was closed while it underwent investigation; it reopened in April 2010.Xcelerator was closed in July 2017 for maintenance. The ride eventually reopened in March 2018. It closed near the end of October 2021 for a new coat of paint; the ride now has the colors red, gray, orange, and yellow. Xcelerator closed again in mid-March 2022 due to a delayed shipment of a part. The park later announced that the ride would be reopening during the summer of 2023. However, On September 21, 2023, Xcelerator ""went dark"" after something broke while testing leaving an unknown reopening date. The ride reopened on November 7th 2023.",,0,2 trains with 5 cars.

Shortly before the ride was installed, it was decided that Europeans know of Batman, but not necessarily all of the related villains. So the track was repainted with red and blue supports and given a Superman theme. The station was given the theme of the Daily Planet offices.
The ride was launched in April 2000 in the theme park Six Flags Holland. Following the sale of all of Six Flags' European parks in 2004, the park was changed to Walibi World just before the beginning of the 2005 season. Any references to Looney Tunes and DC Comics characters had to be removed from the park before opening day. The name of Superman The Ride was changed to Xpress.
The Xpress has nearly the same track layout as the ""Rock 'n' Roller Coaster"" models at Disney Parks. The Xpress' layout is a bit more spacious to compensate for a higher speed launch due to the trains being lighter without the musical hardware.
In 2011, small cracks were found in the stators, and their metal inside started to rust. New stators were ordered, and were delivered in February 2012. Therefore, the coaster was standing but not operating for the whole 2011 season. In August 2011, Walibi Holland decided to re-paint the track, to get rid of the old Superman colors (Black track and Grey supports.). Xpress Reopened In April 2012.
In September 2013, P&P Projects began working on a renovation of the ride set to reopen in 2014.In 2014, the ride was reopened as Xpress Platform 13 with a new theme based on a backstory about a forbidden subway station. The guests walk through this subway station as they enter the ride, which starts out as a normal subway station but gets darker and more horror-based as the guests progress towards the actual ride entrance.

Its serial number is 86. In 1930, it was installed under the name ""Roller Coaster"" at Lakewood Park in Waterbury, Connecticut. Frank F. Hoover oversaw the construction. The coaster operated in Connecticut for only five years before being closed and moved to Canobie Lake Park. It was rechristened the ""Greyhound"" in 1936 through the 1970s. and then eventually it was renamed the ""Yankee Cannonball"" in 1983. The name is in commemoration of the American Civil War. The coaster's train colors were originally blue and gray, representing the Union and Confederate sides of the conflict, all being united on the ride's red, white, and blue superstructure.
When the ride was moved to Canobie in 1936, each section was shortened by six inches to help it fit the area planned for it. The rethemed ride opened for the 1936 season and has operated continuously since, though the lift hill was destroyed by Hurricane Carol in 1954, and it was closed for repair during the following season.
The coaster's coloring has been altered since 1936 with retracking work done on the coaster. Some of this retracking was completed by Martin & Vleminckx. As of the 2009 season, the ride superstructure is white with orange handrails. One train is colored red, white, and blue, while the other is hunter green and orange. The coaster is one of the first rides seen when entering the park's parking lot. On June 20, 2013, the Yankee Cannonball was awarded the prestigious Coaster Landmark Award by ACE for its historical significance, thus cementing its status as a historic, cultural treasure.

In 2014, the park requested a geotechnical investigation of the area, extracting soil samples to assess building a roller coaster's concrete foundation. On 19 December 2017, Canada's Wonderland filed an application for a permit to build nine support footers on the water and amend the waterway with a tunnel travelling under the pond within the park. A permit was required from the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA), as parts of the ride, and the pond beneath it, fall within the Don River watershed. The application was approved by the TRCA on 9 January 2018, with construction on the ride's foundations beginning later that month.
The diversionary channel was built under the pond in order to facilitate the creation of the underwater tunnel, as well as prevent silt runoff downstream. Construction for the diversionary channel, as well as the ride's underwater tunnel, required the temporary removal of two track pieces and a few supports belonging to Vortex, a roller coaster adjacent to Yukon Striker. Work on the tunnel was completed before the park opened for 2018, with the installation of four track pieces and two water pumps to pump rainwater out of the tunnel. With the tunnel completed, the removed pieces from Vortex were reinstalled, allowing for Vortex to be operational by the time the park reopened for the 2018 season.In July 2018, following continuous construction during the operating season, the park began teasing a planned announcement scheduled the following month. On 15 August 2018, the roller coaster was officially introduced to the public, with renderings and details about the ride revealed. Construction for the roller coaster was completed on 4 February 2019, with the installation of the last track piece onto the 360-loop. Installation of the ride train, and landscaping of the surrounding area began after construction was completed.On 24 April 2019, seventy-two people who helped raise funds for The Hospital for Sick Children were invited to test-ride Yukon Striker. In the days that followed, members of the media from Ontario, and neighbouring Buffalo, New York, were invited to ride Yukon Striker. The ride was later opened to the general public on 3 May 2019, during the park's opening day for the 2019 season.",,4,3 trains with 3 cars.

It was designed by Edward Green and manufactured by Edwin Prescott. The coaster was operated independently, and was not part of one of the cohesive amusement parks which existed on Coney Island.The coaster was built at the corner of West 10th and Surf Avenue on Coney Island, near the current location of the famous Coney Island Cyclone and at the location of the former Switchback Railway. The Loop the Loop lasted from 1901 to 1910 but was a relative commercial failure because of the low rider volume. This low rider volume was partly a function of the small cars on the coaster, and partly because safety inspectors would not allow more than one car on the course at any given time, nor would they allow the cars to be joined into trains. The operators attempted to supplement the coaster's revenue by having an observation gallery where patrons could pay to watch others ride the roller coaster.

Young, the owner of the pier. For example, Young commissioned a photograph contest which offered a $40 prize for the best photograph of the new coaster (as well as numerous lesser prizes).

Accounts report the coaster opening in either 1901 or 1902 and then closing in 1907. The coaster was originally designed with the purpose of having cars race out of a giant cannon and then jump over a gap in the track (a so-called ""leap-the-gap"" maneuver), but this gap element was removed in response to safety testing. The coaster was tested with sandbags and while there were some occasional successes, it quickly became clear that changing the weight distribution in the cars even slightly would risk crashes. While no one was hurt or killed, urban legends persisted of fatalities during this testing period.Though the gap was removed, the coaster retained its theme as a giant cannon. When riders reached the summit of the lift hill, they would pass through the ""bore"" of a cannon-shaped tunnel before speeding out from the ""muzzle"" of the cannon. The ride was actually described as being quite boring after the gap was removed, and its lingering popularity was thought to stem from the fictitious, yet gruesome, tales of death during its testing period.",1907,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Soon after it was destroyed, Feucht rebuilt the coaster in even more extreme form. The coaster was also moved several times after the fire. It was moved across the street during the 1910s (in 24 hours) to acquire better rent values and then was moved once more to Luna Park in 1924 (then changing its name to Trip to the Moon) Throughout the years and moves, Feucht continued to make adjustments and improvements to the coaster.

The ride began at the top of a hill, not at ground level, and reached a chained lift hill later on in the ride. It was a third rail electric roller coaster, in which the ride's operator turned off all electric power after the initial ascent. However, when the mechanism broke or the operator failed to turn it off, it would cause the ride to go at speeds too fast and overturn. Three people died on June 22, 1910, and when the train derailed again in 1915 and caused three more deaths, it was decided that the ride should be shut down.

The Giant Coaster was a double out-and-back side-friction coaster designed by John A. Miller and built by Herbert Paul Schmeck of the Philadelphia Toboggan Company (PTC). In 1932, after it was partially destroyed by fire, Schmeck redesigned much of the ride using an underfriction track system. In April 1963, another fire destroyed the station, trains, double helix finale and part of the lift hill. The park asked John C. Allen president of PTC to rebuild the coaster as it was, but his estimate proved too high for the traditional park. Instead he left out two bunny hops and the helix finale in order to create an angled approach into the brake run. Although nowhere near as exciting as Miller's finish, Allen gave the park an affordable alternative to tearing down the coaster.On July 19, 1963, Forest Park Highlands in St. Louis suffered from a massive fire, but its roller coaster, Comet, remained standing. When Comet was torn down in 1968, Paragon Park bought its trains as opposed to buying more expensive ones from PTC.

Iles was a co-owner of Dreamland and had the Scenic Railway constructed at Dreamland from local timber and had mechanical parts for the ride shipped over from the US. The ride drew on ideas from several other designers, but was constructed by local carpenters within the area specified by Iles.Fire destroyed part of the ride in 1949 and the structure required major repairs. Replacement timber for the ride was bought from the dismantled pier at Lowestoft and the ride re-opened in 1950. Fire again destroyed parts of the ride in 1957.Some of the Margate trains were sold to Battersea Fun Fair in the 1960s where they were used on the Scenic Railway there (called the 'Big Dipper' at that site). It was one of the ex-Margate trains that was involved in the Battersea Big Dipper disaster of 1972 when 5 children were killed and several injured. It was during the aftermath of this accident that most of the wooden roller coasters in Britain's amusement parks were removed as, irrespective of the actual standards of safety on the rides, public confidence had been dented.
The Scenic Railway was successfully granted Grade II listed status in 2002, making it the first roller coaster ever to be given any form of protection against demolition. It continued operating until 2006 after Dreamland closed to the public in 2003. On 7 April 2008, it was targeted in an arson attack, and a significant portion of the ride was damaged. In 2011 the ride's listing status was upgraded from Grade II to Grade II* despite the fire damage due to the rarity of the ride and its international significance as one of the world's oldest roller coasters. It reopened in 2015 after going through an extensive repair process.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In October 2012, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
The ride has been known as the Lagoon Dipper, Silver Coaster and Giant Coaster, but its current official name is simply Roller Coaster. Locals often call it the White Roller Coaster because it was painted white for several decades. Around 2004, the park stopped painting the ride as rebuilt portions were constructed using treated lumber. Since then it has gradually changed in color from white to natural brown. However, some people continue calling it the White Roller Coaster despite it now being mostly brown.In early 2018, new Great Coasters International trains replaced the former 4x3x2 Philadelphia Toboggan Coasters trains.

Hershey had The Wild Cat built at a cost of $50,000, to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the town of Hershey. The Wild Cat is a wooden rollercoaster.  It was the first roller coaster built in Hersheypark. However, unlike all other roller coasters built at the park since, Wild Cat was owned by the Philadelphia Toboggan Coasters (PTC) and the land the ride was built on was leased to PTC on an agreement that expired in 1945. 
When the ride opened on June 16, 1923, it was called The Joy Ride, but it was shortly after renamed Wild Cat. The ride stood approximately where the Trailblazer and Storm Runner's Immelmann loop/twist, double roll and snake dive are currently, and the ride went through a tunnel behind the present-day Triple Towers and ""Our Friends of the Sea"" sea lion show. The first woman to ride the roller coaster is Miss Marion Murrie, the daughter of Hershey baseball coach and Hershey Chocolate factory worker William Murrie.The roller coaster operated through the 1945 season.  It had been decided that Wild Cat would be torn down and replaced with a new wooden roller coaster in a different area of the park (now called Comet Hollow).  It had fallen into significant disrepair as a result of the Second World War economy requiring most wood and supplies to go to the United States' war effort. Schmeck designed the replacement roller coaster, Comet, which was Milton Hershey's last purchased ride (he died before Comet's completion), and is still in operation as of the 2022 Hersheypark season. 
In 1996, Hersheypark revived the Wildcat name for a wooden roller coaster constructed by Great Coasters International, using the slogan, The Cat is back! This coaster closed on July 31, 2022. It was replaced by Wildcat's Revenge, a hybrid roller coaster constructed by Rocky Mountain Construction, which opened in 2023.","September 9, 1945",0,3 trains with 3 cars.

When Thunderhawk opened on March 30,1924 and for many years after the ride was known simply as the Coaster. The Coaster was renamed Thunderhawk with the addition of the Hercules roller coaster to the park in 1989.
Originally, the Coaster was built as an out-and-back coaster, meaning it went straight out from the first drop, turned around and came straight back. The ride was reconfigured in 1930 to its present design with a figure-eight twister section in the middle of the ride. Over the years, the ride has seen many cosmetic changes. At one point the ride featured a bright yellow paint job, which has since been painted over with an off-white color.
The original station pavilion featured a separate bumper car ride, around which wrapped the line for the Coaster, providing some entertainment to those waiting in line. Originally, the ride began with a tunneled section and ended with another tunneled section, as the train went under the portion of the pavilion devoted to the bumper cars. However, the bumper cars were removed following Cedar Fair's purchase of the park in 1993, leaving the tunnel that began the ride as an open concrete trench. In addition, a set of brakes was placed in the middle of the return bunny hills causing the train to slow down and lose much of its trademark airtime.
The Thunderhawk structure was maintained by carpenter Paul Hottenstein, nicknamed ""Shorty,"" from 1961 until his sudden death in the winter of 2001. A plaque in the ride's station honors him and his work on the ride.
Thunderhawk continues to be one of the park's most popular and beloved rides. To this day, it remains a classic example of an early American wooden roller coaster.
For the 2016 season, Dorney Park announced major renovations to Thunderhawk. Among the changes were new trains designed by Philadelphia Toboggan Coasters, featuring an open-air design, with individual ratcheting lap bars (as opposed to the previous ""buzz bars""). The ride also received a new coat of white paint, reminiscent of the coaster's original color, and a new white lighting package to outline the entire ride.In 2021, the American Coaster Enthusiasts gave Thunderhawk an ACE Coaster Landmark plaque.",,0,2 trains with 4 cars.

The Mission Beach Amusement Center was built at a cost of $2.5 million and opened in 1925, with this roller coaster as one of its main attractions.  It was designed by Church and Prior, coaster designers based in Venice, California, who also oversaw its construction.  The Spreckelses bequeathed the attraction to the city, which in 1954 was leased to Jack Ray.  He renamed the park Belmont Park, after another park in Montreal.  The roller coaster was severely damaged by fire in 1955, and Ray subsequently declared bankruptcy.Threatened with demolition by the city in 1978, local citizens banded together to rescue it and a few surviving attractions of the defunct park.

It was designed by noted roller coaster engineers Frank Prior and Frederick Church and built by the Traver Engineering Company. The coaster was built approximately 500 feet (150 m) out onto Liberty Pier in Long Island Sound and could be easily seen from up and down the beach and from several nearby piers. It was quite popular, financially successful, and is thought to have driven at least one other nearby coaster out of business.In 1936, the Thunderbolt was struck by lightning which caused damage to its mechanical operation. The coaster was closed the remainder of that year but reopened for the 1937 season. In 1938, however, the coaster was destroyed by the Great New England Hurricane. The coaster was rebuilt in 1939 and renamed the Giant Flyer. The ride was somewhat modified in this rebuild, however, and is thought to have become a less exciting ride as a result; it was demolished in 1957. The flagpole from the ride is preserved in the Savin Rock Museum.","September 21, 1938",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ride was Whalom Park's third roller coaster since the park opened in 1893, and no new coasters ever replaced it or were added to the park.

The ride was 3000 feet long, and had a top speed of 55 mph and lasted two minutes and ten seconds. It had two trains, each with five cars, arranged with two per row, two rows per car, for a total of 20 riders per train.
The coaster was originally designed to run with five car trains, but during the last years of its operation, they were shortened to four to allow the last carts to be used for spare parts. The roller coaster stood abandoned for 25 years until it was demolished on July 11, 2012.
In 1964, a man died on the roller coaster as a result of standing up as it ascended the first lift.
In 1968, the rear car of one of the trains became disconnected while ascending the final hill, causing it to roll backward. As a result, the train derailed, dropping six people to the ground ten feet below with minor injuries. The mishap was possibly caused by the passengers rocking the car, damaging the coupler. The original trains were removed and replaced with newer Century Flyer trains. During the era when Hoffman owned Lincoln Park, safety became a bigger concern, and more accidents on the Comet resulted in its closing.On August 17, 1986, an electrician working on the coaster fell more than 55 feet causing immediate death. On September 29, 1987, four people were injured when the braking system failed. The cars jackknifed into the roller coaster wood and as a result, Comet was closed.The trains were purchased by Little Amerricka Amusement Park when the ride closed. Little Amerricka also expressed interest in buying the coaster in 2002. The owner of Lincoln Park at the time, Walter Bronhard, offered to sell the coaster for $90,000, but received no buyers. Various efforts were made to save the coaster; however, the coaster's lift had partially collapsed in January 2005 due to rot. Little Amerricka proposed to build an exact replica of the ride but it was cancelled. Having abandoned all proposals and future plans, the remainder of the Comet was demolished on July 11, 2012.","September 29, 1987",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 1954 the new coaster opened to the public with the name ""Junior Coaster"".. The ride operated in this form until 1961 when the ride would go through a major overhaul. The at the time park owner George W. Long had just returned from a vacation to Disneyland where he rode the state-of-the-art Matterhorn Bobsleds roller coaster. While on that trip George drew up plans on a napkin to redesign the ""Junior Coaster"" at his park into a toned-down Matterhorn Bobsleds. In the offseason between 1961 and 1962, the ""Junior Coaster"" was renamed into ""Bobsleds"", added a third story onto the ride, and giving the coaster steel tubular track. A hybrid coaster is a coaster made of steel and wood. Several other roller coasters have been hybrids with steel supports and a wooden track, but this coaster was one of the first in the world to use wooden supports and a steel track. In 2019, 57 years after reopening as a hybrid coaster, Seabreeze began looking into replacing the ride since it had gotten rough and was a headache for the maintenance team. Luckily, Seabreeze was able to partner with Amuse Rides and acquire steel to fully retract the ride and redesign the trains. Brandon Paul, president of Amuse Rides, estimated that Bobsleds should be around for at least another 60 years.

Several smaller coasters were added during this time, but only two remained by 1963. For the 1964 season, Philadelphia Toboggan Company was hired to build a new roller coaster under the direction of Frank F. Hoover and John C. Allen. Blue Streak opened to the public on May 23, 1964. It was one of only three roller coasters operating at the time within the park. The attraction's success led to a rebirth of roller coasters at Cedar Point, including the installation of Cedar Creek Mine Ride (1969), Corkscrew (1976), Gemini (1978) and Wilderness Run (1979).Blue Streak features a traditional ""out-and-back"" layout design. The roller coaster was named after the local Sandusky High School athletic nickname ""The Blue Streaks"". Cedar Point invested US$200,000 (equivalent to $1,887,124 in 2022) to construct the wooden roller coaster, and it remains a favorite at the park, consistently getting 30 minute to hour waits, and within annual roller coaster polls. In Amusement Today's 2013 Golden Ticket Awards, Blue Streak was ranked 27th among wooden roller coasters worldwide – its highest ranking to date.On July 20, 2022, during Coaster Con 44, American Coaster Enthusiasts designated Blue Streak a Coaster Landmark.",,0,2 trains with 4 cars.

Aspects of the coaster's design served as an inspiration for the designers of future roller coasters, such as Screamin' Eagle and Colossus. In the 1980s, Montaña Rusa underwent a major $800,000 renovation and refurbishment for safety and ride comfort. Following the work, the original coaster builder responded with a tongue-in-cheek remark that he was ""at least 80 percent sure"" that roller coaster passengers would remain in the trains' seats.
In 2006, Luis Felipe Santamaría set a record for roller coaster endurance by riding on Montaña Rusa for a total of 1,333 consecutive rides. He did not leave the train, and only briefly stopped for medical checks. Santamaría both ate and slept on the roller coaster.In April 2022, works began to demolish the structure, marking the final of the ""Montaña Rusa"" as La Feria de Chapultepec is going to become ""Parque Aztlán"", with Mexico City as the main theme for future attractions.",13 October 2019,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was originally thought to have been moved to Casino Pier from a brief run at Palisades Amusement Park. Instead, it seems that it was bought new from Anton Schwarzkopf's company in Germany. Casino Pier had operated Wild Mouse roller coasters in the late 1950s, but by the mid 1960s, ridership numbers were dropping. The Park's operator, Ken Wynne, was traveling in Europe when he found the coaster he thought would be the best replacement—a Jet Star coaster built by Schwarzkopf. Wynne believed that it would provide a much more exciting ride experience than the earlier Wild Mouse coasters.During the construction of Jet Star, there was some debate on where it should be located on Casino Pier. One story tells of how Wynne told the ride dealer, Roland Koch, where on the pier the coaster should be built. When Wynne returned from lunch, he discovered that Koch had begun to build the coaster in a completely different part of the pier. After a long argument, Koch's preferred location won and the coaster was built where the dealer wanted—at the very end of the pier, overlooking the ocean. As the later Star Jet would ultimately replace the Jet Star, this placement may have proven unlucky for the later coaster, as it was only the far corner of Casino Pier which collapsed during Hurricane Sandy, sending the later coaster into the surf in 2012.The Jet Star was removed from Casino Pier in 2000. There were some attempts to sell the coaster, but refurbishment would have been too costly. The coaster was ultimately scrapped and the cars sold off.",2000,0,,,Star Jet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 2000, the coaster was redesigned to look like the larger Goliath roller coaster, located in the same park, and relocated near to it. The old supports were replaced with supports that resembled those found on the Goliath and the trains were rebuilt from the chassis up. It was repainted with Goliath's color scheme and given the name Goliath Jr. (Goliath Junior) to reopen in 2001.In the 2007-2008 off-season Goliath Jr. was rethemed to Percy's Railway to match Six Flags Magic Mountain's new kids zone, Thomas Town. Similarly to the Goliath Jr. makeover, the cars were rebuilt to resemble Percy the Small Engine (the leading car) and his Troublesome Trucks (the two following cars), all from the television series Thomas & Friends.In late 2010, Six Flags began the process of removing licensed theming from attractions. They terminated several licenses including that for Thomas the Tank Engine. The Thomas Town at Six Flags Magic Mountain has been renamed and rethemed to Whistlestop Park which reopened on March 19, 2011. Percy's Railway was now again rethemed and renamed to Magic Flyer.

On May 30, 2013, Great Escape announced that their Canyon Blaster roller coaster would be running backwards for the first time ever during 2013 season for a limited time during the summer.",1997,0,,,,,,42 in (107 cm),,43°21′6.71″N 73°41′29.93″W﻿ / ﻿43.3518639°N 73.6916472°W,36°12′29″N 86°41′42″W﻿ / ﻿36.208°N 86.695°W,Operating,Removed,"June 27, 2003",1972,43°21′6.71″N 73°41′29.93″W﻿ / ﻿43.3518639°N 73.6916472°W,36°12′29″N 86°41′42″W﻿ / ﻿36.208°N 86.695°W,Operating,Removed,"June 27, 2003",1972,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Ghosttown,Doo-Wah Diddy City,Ghosttown,Doo-Wah Diddy City,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although Jumbo Jet was only at Cedar Point for a short time, the roller coaster subsequently moved to a number of different amusement parks, including Palace Playland in Maine, Malmö Folkets Park in Sweden, Beoland in Russia, Dreamland in Belarus, and its present location of Chelyuskintsev Park also located in Belarus.",,0,,,WildCat,,,,,53°55′11″N 27°36′53″E﻿ / ﻿53.91976°N 27.6147°E,53°55′52″N 27°31′01″E﻿ / ﻿53.931°N 27.517°E,Operating,Removed,2015,2010,56°18′29″N 43°59′46″E﻿ / ﻿56.308°N 43.996°E,55°35′38″N 13°00′54″E﻿ / ﻿55.594°N 13.015°E,Removed,Removed,2003,1985,,2014,2006,1989,Unknown,,,,,,,,,,43°30′54″N 70°22′30″W﻿ / ﻿43.515°N 70.375°W,41°28′55″N 82°41′06″W﻿ / ﻿41.482°N 82.685°W,Removed,Removed,Unknown,1972,53°55′11″N 27°36′53″E﻿ / ﻿53.91976°N 27.6147°E,53°55′52″N 27°31′01″E﻿ / ﻿53.931°N 27.517°E,56°18′29″N 43°59′46″E﻿ / ﻿56.308°N 43.996°E,Operating,Removed,Removed,2015,2010,2003,,,,,55°35′38″N 13°00′54″E﻿ / ﻿55.594°N 13.015°E,Removed,1985,,,43°30′54″N 70°22′30″W﻿ / ﻿43.515°N 70.375°W,41°28′55″N 82°41′06″W﻿ / ﻿41.482°N 82.685°W,53°55′11″N 27°36′53″E﻿ / ﻿53.91976°N 27.6147°E,53°55′52″N 27°31′01″E﻿ / ﻿53.931°N 27.517°E,56°18′29″N 43°59′46″E﻿ / ﻿56.308°N 43.996°E,Removed,Removed,Operating,Removed,Removed,Unknown,1972,2015,2010,2003,1978,2014,2006,1989,,,55°35′38″N 13°00′54″E﻿ / ﻿55.594°N 13.015°E,43°30′54″N 70°22′30″W﻿ / ﻿43.515°N 70.375°W,41°28′55″N 82°41′06″W﻿ / ﻿41.482°N 82.685°W,53°55′11″N 27°36′53″E﻿ / ﻿53.91976°N 27.6147°E,53°55′52″N 27°31′01″E﻿ / ﻿53.931°N 27.517°E,Removed,Removed,Removed,Operating,Removed,1985,Unknown,1972,2015,2010,Unknown,1978.0,2014.0,2006.0,56°18′29″N 43°59′46″E﻿ / ﻿56.308°N 43.996°E,55°35′38″N 13°00′54″E﻿ / ﻿55.594°N 13.015°E,43°30′54″N 70°22′30″W﻿ / ﻿43.515°N 70.375°W,41°28′55″N 82°41′06″W﻿ / ﻿41.482°N 82.685°W,53°55′11″N 27°36′53″E﻿ / ﻿53.91976°N 27.6147°E,Removed,Removed,Removed,Removed,Operating,2003.0,1985,Unknown,1972,2015,1989,Unknown,1978.0,2014.0,53°55′52″N 27°31′01″E﻿ / ﻿53.931°N 27.517°E,56°18′29″N 43°59′46″E﻿ / ﻿56.308°N 43.996°E,55°35′38″N 13°00′54″E﻿ / ﻿55.594°N 13.015°E,43°30′54″N 70°22′30″W﻿ / ﻿43.515°N 70.375°W,41°28′55″N 82°41′06″W﻿ / ﻿41.482°N 82.685°W,Removed,Removed,Removed,Removed,Removed,2010,2003.0,1985,Unknown,1972,2006.0,1989.0,Unknown,1978.0,53°55′11″N 27°36′53″E﻿ / ﻿53.91976°N 27.6147°E,53°55′52″N 27°31′01″E﻿ / ﻿53.931°N 27.517°E,56°18′29″N 43°59′46″E﻿ / ﻿56.308°N 43.996°E,55°35′38″N 13°00′54″E﻿ / ﻿55.594°N 13.015°E,43°30′54″N 70°22′30″W﻿ / ﻿43.515°N 70.375°W,41°28′55″N 82°41′06″W﻿ / ﻿41.482°N 82.685°W,Operating,Removed,Removed,Removed,Removed,Removed,2015,2010,2003.0,1985,Unknown,1972,2014.0,2006.0,1989.0,Unknown,1978.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although new roller coasters were still being built, the demand wouldn't be the same for decades to come. By the 1960s, the industry was at an all-time low. Traditional amusement park rides, such as carousels, mill chutes, and even wooden roller coasters were losing popularity with newer generations. This led president of Philadelphia Toboggan Company and well-known coaster designer, John C. Allen, to decide in 1968 that it was time to retire. Allen was one of the last remaining designers with experience from the first golden age of roller coasters having studied under legendary designer Herbert Schmeck.The Wachs' family owned and operated Cincinnati's Coney Island before selling to Taft Broadcasting in 1969, but they remained in control of park operations and made many decisions during the construction of Kings Island. Determined to recapture some of Coney Island's traditional themes at the new park, Gary Wachs and his father met Allen in 1970 at an IAAPA convention in Chicago. They convinced Allen to officially come out of retirement and design a roller coaster that would be as popular as Shooting Star at Coney Island, but also unique at the same time.
Construction of the attraction began in 1970. The first test runs were conducted in September 1971. The Racer opened officially to the public at Kings Island's grand opening on April 28, 1972. It is located in Coney Mall, a section of the park originally known as Coney Island. The roller coaster appeared on national television in 1973, when it was featured in an episode of The Brady Bunch called ""The Cincinnati Kids"". The ride ignited interest in roller coasters following decades of decline, and the attention it received eventually led to a revival of the industry around the world, typically referred to as the industry's second golden age.
Both sides of the track raced forward until May 28, 1982, when the trains on one side of the track were reversed to ride backwards. The Racer became the first racing roller coaster in the world to do so. It is thought that this move was to accommodate guests who were frustrated over the frequent closure of The Bat, a recently added attraction. Though only intended for the remainder of the 1982 operating season, the change lasted twenty-six years due to its popularity. It wasn't until 2008 that Cedar Fair restored The Racer to its original form by changing the right track to ride forward again. In addition, each side was assigned a color—red and blue—with the red trains on the right and the blue trains on the left.
On June 18, 2007, The Racer was awarded the Coaster Landmark Award by the American Coaster Enthusiasts (ACE). A plaque for the award is on display near the ride's entrance.As part of a routine, annual maintenance program common with wooden coasters, sections of The Racer are occasionally retracked over the years as needed. For the 2019 season, the back turns and several other small sections of The Racer were retracked by Great Coasters International, the company behind Kings Island's Mystic Timbers in 2017. The Racer's first drop and turns out of the station were refurbished previously several years earlier. Then in 2021, by The Gravity Group, more than 500 feet (150 m) of track that stretched from the base of the first drop to the fourth airtime hill was replaced to allow for a smoother ride experience. That year, the original entrance sign and train logos were restored. During the 2021-2022 off season the ride got repainted for the park's 50th anniversary celebration.",,0,4 trains with 5 cars.

Manufactured by Arrow Development, the ride opened with the park in 1972 and remained its only full-size coaster until Wabash Cannonball opened in 1975 as part of a major park expansion. It carried a rustic mine train theme, though unlike many similar coasters at other parks, it did not enter a tunnel or travel underground. In the late 1970s, the coaster was renamed Rock n' Roller Coaster, when its park area was rethemed to ""Doo-Wah Diddy City"", paying homage to the doo wop music of the 1950s. As part of the re-theming, its trains and buildings associated with the ride were repainted in bright pastel colors.
After Opryland closed in 1997, the coaster was disassembled and sold to Premier Parks. After being stored at the Old Indiana Fun Park in Thorntown, Indiana for several years, the ride was relocated to The Great Escape in Queensbury, New York and renamed Canyon Blaster in 2003.
On May 30, 2013, Great Escape announced that their Canyon Blaster roller coaster would be running backwards for the first time ever during 2013 season for a limited time during the summer.",1997,0,,,,,,42 in (107 cm),,43°21′6.71″N 73°41′29.93″W﻿ / ﻿43.3518639°N 73.6916472°W,36°12′29″N 86°41′42″W﻿ / ﻿36.208°N 86.695°W,Operating,Removed,"June 27, 2003",1972,43°21′6.71″N 73°41′29.93″W﻿ / ﻿43.3518639°N 73.6916472°W,36°12′29″N 86°41′42″W﻿ / ﻿36.208°N 86.695°W,Operating,Removed,"June 27, 2003",1972,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Ghosttown,Doo-Wah Diddy City,Ghosttown,Doo-Wah Diddy City,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Allen of the Philadelphia Toboggan Coasters (PTC). It is based on the first three roller coasters he designed shortly after becoming the company's president in 1954. These coasters opened in 1956 at Hunt's Pier, Angela Park and the Gooding Zoo (now the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium).  Allen modified the original design, making Woodstock Express a little taller and longer.  He eliminated the curved loading station as well, opting instead for an in-line station that precedes the curve to the lift hill.  This modified design was then used to build two nearly identical models at Kings Dominion and Carowinds. A third copy at Canada's Wonderland was also based on this design but is taller and slightly longer, and it was designed by Curtis D. Summers.The coaster was originally named Scooby Doo and opened with the park in 1972 as part of ""The Happy Land of Hanna-Barbera"".  Paying homage to The Beast after its successful launch in 1979, Scooby Doo was renamed The Beastie, and a tunnel was added to the bottom of its first drop in time for the 1980 season.  In 2006, a decision was made during the Nickelodeon Universe overhaul to remove the tunnel and rename it to Fairly Odd Coaster (based on the Nickelodeon TV show The Fairly OddParents). Although Cedar Fair had the rights to continue using the themes through 2016 following its purchase of the park in 2006, it was decided to remove all remaining Hanna-Barbera and Nickelodeon themes from the kids area in time for the start of the 2010 season. As a result, the ride went through another name change to Woodstock Express in line with the new Planet Snoopy makeover.Woodstock Express was awarded ACE Coaster Classic status, but that status has since been rescinded as a result of recent changes to the coaster.",,0,2 trains with 5 cars.

Jim Copp, Kings Dominion’s first vice president of finance and administration, chose the name “Rebel Yell”after being inspired by a brand of bourbon called Rebel Yell. In 1992, the trains on one side were changed to face and run backwards, which was a similar change made on Kings Island's The Racer a decade earlier in 1982. Locals would call this reversed version of the ride the “Yell Rebel”. Both were restored to their original configurations in 2008, not long after Cedar Fair purchased the chain of parks from Paramount. For the park's 40th anniversary in 2014, the trains were repainted red or blue to represent their original color scheme and chasing lights were added back to the water park side of the track.The Rebel Yell name was dropped in 2018 when the coaster was renamed Racer 75. The new name was labeled an amalgam that mixes references to the coaster's racing configuration, the year it opened and the ACE acronym for American Coaster Enthusiasts – a club organization that traces its founding back to a 1977 riding event at the park involving Rebel Yell. While the park didn't acknowledge the reason, the name change coincided with discussions within the state legislature surrounding the removal of Confederate statuary icons throughout Virginia; “Rebel Yell” was also the name of a Confederate battle cry.",,0,4 trains with 5 cars.

Shortly before the park's 1993 season, the name was expanded to ""Scooby-Doo's Ghoster Coaster"".  
In 1993, Paramount Parks bought Carowinds' parent company and added areas themed to the Nickelodeon television channel, owned by their parent company Viacom.  As part of this, the Hanna-Barbera area was eventually annexed into the Nickelodeon Central area, and in 2005, the roller coaster was renamed ""Fairly Odd Coaster"".
As part of the new theming, the wooden superstructure was painted indigo, and the cars repainted to mimic the Fairy Oddparents characters from the show; one train pink and the other green, with the fairies' faces on the front of the cars. To depict these characters as roller coaster trains is accurate to the television show because on screen, the fairies can change their shape at will, though their faces always remain visible on whatever they become.
The coaster was renamed Woodstock Express in 2010 when the area was rethemed as Planet Snoopy.

Both were painted light seafoam green and were among some of the first roller coasters to feature a double corkscrew. They also featured two airtime hills after the first drop. The hills were well known for ejecting loose articles from the trains, such as hats, sunglasses and stuffed animals. The ride was custom-built for both parks.
After the 1979 season, Turn of the Century was heavily modified. The airtime hills after the first drop were removed and replaced with two back to back vertical loops and a lighted tunnel. Fake rock formations were built around the second loop and around the first half of the lift hill, with a third formation just before the corkscrews. The entire ride was painted black and was renamed Demon. In addition to the re-design, the theme was changed as well. Fog machines were placed in the tunnels, blood red colored water fell out of the rock formation by the corkscrews and a unique logo was unveiled. The original trains were also modified. A three-dimensional logo was attached to the front car of each train and flames were painted on the sides of the cars. After the loops were added, it became the second four-inversion roller coaster, after the Carolina Cyclone at Carowinds which opened two months earlier.
The storyline of the ride's transformation heard in the Demon soundtrack is that the park accidentally missed three payments on the roller coaster, and that a demon has repossessed the ride.
For a period in the 80s, the Demon at both Great America parks was branded with the Looney Tunes Tasmanian Devil character.",,4,3 trains with 6 cars.

Previously, Jet Star 2 had a blinking lighted sign at the top of the lift hill. This sign was removed when the ride was repainted with its current bright red and yellow color scheme in 2006. Before 2005, the colors on Jet Star 2 were reversed with red track and yellow supports. In 2012, Jet Star 2's loading platform was remodeled slightly so that the capacity could increase due to its constant popularity.Jet Star 2 had a large enough impact with the local residents of Spokane, WA during the 1974 World's Fair that local brewery NoLi Brewhouse has named one of their brews ""Jet Star"" after the ride.",,0,Single train with a single car.

Reports a day before its formal announcement in September 1975 indicated that a new thrill ride, named ""The Python"", would be constructed. On September 25, 1975, Busch Gardens announced the construction of Python, a roller coaster that was promoted to reach speeds of 50 miles per hour (80 km/h) and have a 50-foot-tall (15 m) drop. The roller coaster would cost $2 million dollars as part of a $7.6 million dollar expansion of the park, and was expected to open by the 1976 summer season. In October 1975, the general manager of Busch Gardens Tampa, William Thurman, expected the expansion to be approved by the city of Tampa due to the recent success seen at the Busch Gardens parks.
In January 1976, Thom Stork, the publicity manager for Busch Gardens Tampa, voiced the expansion that included Python would appeal to all ages and carry ""the balance we think we need"" for the park. By March 1976, it was observed in The Tampa Tribune that materials and plans were being looked over during a visit by the Syrian Ministry of Tourism. Vertical construction was observed to continue between April and May 1976. In the same time frame of its reported construction, it was stated that Python would open in mid-June. Python opened on July 1, 1976, as the first roller coaster at Busch Gardens Tampa. Upon opening, Python became Florida's first roller coaster to feature inversions.Rumors of Python closing began in September 2006, as Busch Gardens filed permits to demolish the corner of the Congo section which hosted the roller coaster. The replacement for the roller coaster was further speculated to be part of an 164,000 square feet (15,200 m2) expansion to the Congo section. The original permit for demolishing the section of the park was turned down by city officials wanting a more in-depth plan. On October 28, 2006, the park announced that Python would not reopen for the 2007 season. The ride permanently closed on October 31, 2006, and was removed after 30 years of operation. Along with Python, the area's restaurant were torn down as a part of the Congo renovation. After the demolition of Python, the trains were sent to Busch Gardens Williamsburg for their Arrow Development roller coaster, Loch Ness Monster. Approval for the new section of the park took place on June 14, 2007, which would become Jungala, and later opened on April 5, 2008.","October 31, 2006",2,,,Jungala,,US$2 million ($10.3 million in 2022 dollars[1]),42 in (107 cm),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although one of the parks was abandoned due to local opposition, the other two opened as planned in 1976.Both parks were named Marriott's Great America, and the first opened in Santa Clara, California, on March 20, 1976. The second opened in Gurnee, Illinois, on May 29, 1976. One of the headlining attractions at both parks on opening day was Willard's Whizzer, which was named after Marriott founder J.

Simply entitled Double Loop, the new design would become the first roller coaster in the world to feature back-to-back vertical loops. It was introduced at the park in 1977 at a total cost of $1.35 million.The ride featured a 90-foot-drop (27 m), a helix, 1,800 feet (550 m) of track, and two vertical loops with one measuring 55 feet (17 m) in height and the other measuring 50 feet (15 m). Double Loop would be followed by the park's very own Corkscrew roller coaster – one of fourteen identical installations eventually produced by Arrow – which opened the following year in 1978. Both gave Geauga Lake the title of becoming the first amusement park to feature multiple looping roller coasters.Double Loop's support structure was originally painted white, but would later be painted dark to match the track. The attraction debuted with two trains, one red and the other yellow. In 1993, the coaster underwent refurbishment adding some modernization to the control system. The outdated relay and photo eye controls were replaced with newer proximity switches to help improve reliability and to reduce downtime. Following Geauga Lake's acquisition by Six Flags, Double Loop was given a makeover in 2000, with a new paint scheme featuring a yellow track and purple supports. The yellow train was repainted a darker shade of yellow, while the red train was converted to purple.","September 16, 2007",2,2 trains with 6 cars.

During the roller coaster's planning stages, Hershey shortlisted a group of names to ""merry Derry dip"" and ""sooperdooperLooper"". An executive of Hershey preferred the former ""merry Derry dip"" as it referenced the Derry Township, the area where Hershey, Pennsylvania, was located. However, the latter was ultimately chosen when the executive was outvoted by his wife and children. The roller coaster was bought in Zürich, Switzerland, in February 1976.Hersheypark announced its intentions to add a new looping roller coaster for the 1977 season in April 1976. The new roller coaster would include a vertical loop and would be located near the park's amphitheater and log flume. The attraction would be similar to the Great American Revolution at Magic Mountain, an amusement park in Valencia, California. Work began on the project site on October 29, 1976. The name of the roller coaster was presented in December 1976 to the media as the ""SooperDooperLooper"" along with illustrations. Parts of the roller coaster arrived from its European manufacturer, with foundation work beginning in the early weeks of December. The attraction was said to be the park's ""most structurally involved"" project to date, at the time.Construction of the SooperDooperLooper continued into the winter months, causing minor problems when mechanical equipment broke down. Preparation on the roller coaster's vertical loop and station were conducted in February 1977. In the same month, 80 percent of the 8,300,000 pounds (3,800,000 kg) of concrete for the foundation work was complete. The roller coaster's vertical loop was finished in March. Construction on the roller coaster was completed in early May. A preview ceremony for the roller coaster was hosted by the park on May 6, where 250 visitors were in attendance. The SooperDooperLooper was officially opened to the public alongside the park's season on May 8. The park touted the looping roller coaster as the longest to open in the East Coast region. A 150-foot (46-meter) tunnel featuring lights and sounds was added to the roller coaster for the 1979 season.",,1,,Giant Wheel Alpine Flyer,,,$3 million,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Lap bar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"May 6, 1977",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the opening of the park's Oktoberfest section the next year, two roller coasters were added: Das Kätzchen, a children's coaster, and its adult counterpart, Wildkatze. As part of its strategy to add an attraction every other year, Anheuser-Busch announced the Loch Ness Monster on July 27, 1977. The thrill ride would be added at Williamsburg Busch Gardens in 1978 and would be the largest ride at the park upon its opening. The ride would be located in the center of the park in the Scotland-themed area and cost around $5 million. The announcement followed expansion plans for the Anheuser-Busch brewery in Williamsburg, as well as similar thrill additions being announced at other theme parks, including its sister park in Tampa, Florida.Permits for the roller coaster's foundations and several Anheuser-Busch projects were approved in August by the James City County. In anticipation for the new additions, Busch Gardens Williamsburg would increase ticket prices in November. A groundbreaking ceremony was held and construction started in December. Supplemental construction permits were approved by the county in January 1978 for the roller coaster. Construction of the roller coaster was conducted during the winter months, which slowed progress, and was kept relatively hidden to build public anticipation. The Loch Ness Monster was physically revealed to the press on March 2. With the roller coaster nearing completion, the opening date was announced for June. The park's general manager, John Roberts, touted the roller coaster as being the fastest and tallest, and having the steepest drop in the world. The roller coaster would also debut with interlocking loops and a tunnel.The roller coaster was topped off on April 13, 1978, with final welding, construction of the tunnel, and landscaping to be completed. As part of a marketing ploy, the park searched for eight people to be the first riders to take on the Loch Ness Monster. The eight people represented to take on the roller coaster were athletes in American football, NASCAR racing, ice hockey, and stunt personnel. The Loch Ness Monster opened to the public on June 2. A week later on June 9, the park hosted the inaugural American Coaster Enthusiasts (ACE) convention, partially surrounding the roller coaster's opening. The roller coaster was christened on June 19, by Alex Campbell, an individual claimed to have seen the Loch Ness Monster.Following a month of rumors in September 2023, Busch Gardens Williamsburg announced the Loch Ness Monster would undertake a renovation for the 2024 season. Throughout the remainder of the 2023 season, sections of the track would be replaced with brand new track while a shade covering was added over the final brake run and various sections of track were repainted. The ride is scheduled to reopen in May 2024 while an all-new sighting center is scheduled be open April 4-21 as a walkthrough attraction highlighting milestones and archived photographs of the attraction.",,2,,,,,USD$5 million ($22.4 million in 2022 dollars[1]),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Loch Ness Monster,,Over-the-shoulder,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on the launch mechanism for aircraft carriers, the flywheel-launched shuttle loop is a successor of the drop-tower launch shuttle, and predates modern LIM and hydraulic launch systems by over 15 years. The drop tower models had a large silo with a weight inside connected to a similar launch system. The weight would drop, thus pulling the cable and bob, launching the train. Drawbacks included no adjustments for inclement weather. Also, the drop-tower launch was nowhere as intense as the flywheel launch, taking almost two seconds longer to reach the same speed.
The nearby Jaguar! roller coaster, which opened in 1995, passes directly through the center of Montezooma's loop. In 2002, Montezooma's Revenge was repainted in a teal and yellow color scheme. In 2008, Knott's opened Pony Express, a small ""out and back"" steel roller coaster with a flywheel launch system much like Montezooma's Revenge.In 2017, Montezooma's Revenge was painted with orange track and dark green supports. The ride closed for a major refurbishment throughout the 2022 and 2023 seasons and has no reopening date planned.

Since its debut, Mindbender has had three different color schemes and been counted within three different sections of the park. In its inaugural season, the attraction was part of the USA section and was silver in color. In 1979, Mindbender became part of the new Jolly Roger's Island, itself an offshoot of the USA section. The structure was painted brown during the 1980s. Throughout its first two decades, the trains were silver in color, with a rainbow-colored stripe along both sides.
In 1996, it was announced that Jolly Roger's Island would be converted into Gotham City for the 1997 season with the addition of Batman: The Ride. Mindbender was painted green to suggest that it was the creation of Batman's arch-enemy, The Riddler. A waterfall under the coaster was dyed green, and occasionally still is (although at times it retains a more natural color). The trains were painted black, and covered with green question marks, another hallmark of the Riddler. During the 2009 Southeastern United States floods, sections of the Mindbender were temporarily submerged under muddy water. The park was able to clean up and reopen the weekend following the floods.
The attraction was closed after the 2019 season to undergo a refurbishment as part of the new Gotham City section of the park planned for 2020. It was renamed The Riddler Mindbender, given a new coat of paint, an updated queue line, as well as new trains and refurbished sections of track. The new trains consisted of five cars instead of seven, and the control system was replaced in the process. The Riddler Mindbender's unveiling was delayed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The ride would be a looping coaster manufactured by Anton Schwarzkopf. It would require 437,000 lb (198,000 kg) of steel and 4,800,000 lb (2,200,000 kg) of concrete to build.Shock Wave opened to the public on April 22, 1978. At the time of its opening, it was the tallest roller coaster in the world. It lost this title within weeks upon the opening of The Loch Ness Monster at Busch Gardens Williamsburg.
The ride is built on Johnson Creek real estate and had to temporarily close in the 2004 season because of a flood. Shock Wave was temporarily closed again in early 2008 for an extensive remodeling.Six Flags announced on March 3, 2016, that Shock Wave would be among several rides at various parks that would receive a virtual reality (VR) upgrade. Riders had the option to wear Samsung Gear VR headsets, powered by Oculus, to create a 360-degree, 3D experience while riding. The virtual reality experience was called, The New Revolution, themed to a fighter jet, has riders flying through a futuristic city as co-pilots battling alien invaders. The feature debuted with the coaster when it reopened in spring of 2016. For the park's annual Fright Fest, the virtual reality ride became Rage of the Gargoyles.In 2017, Six Flags discontinued the VR experience on Shockwave.

The statement read, ""Kings Island Family Entertainment Center will open America’s champion roller coaster in the spring of 1979."" It was the first official announcement from the park, who had been secretly planning the new ride for three years. Looking to replicate the national exposure received from popular rides such as The Racer and record-breaking events including Evel Knievel's nationally televised bus jump in 1975, Kings Island sought to keep the momentum going by introducing another record-breaking attraction.Original plans focused on building a replica of the iconic Shooting Star, a popular roller coaster which once stood at Coney Island in Cincinnati. Charles Dinn – director of the Kings Island's construction, maintenance and engineering division – had recorded measurements of the Shooting Star's layout and dimensions prior to its demolition in 1971. The park later selected an area near The Racer where the replica would be built. Management eventually determined it was in their best interest to shelve the idea and instead push forward with a bigger design. The Shooting Star would later be resurrected in the layout design of Mighty Canadian Minebuster at Canada's Wonderland, which opened in 1981. For the 1979 coaster, Kings Island set its sights on an attraction that would transcend the Shooting Star's nostalgia and appeal to a wider audience.",,0,3 trains with 6 cars.

However, because the pavilion as a whole was deemed too expensive in light of the construction and 1973 opening of Pirates of the Caribbean, Baxter proposed severing the mine train and building it as a separate attraction.
The Big Thunder Mountain Railroad project was put on hold again in 1974 as resources and personnel were being diverted to work on constructing Space Mountain in Tomorrowland, but this delay may have ultimately produced a smoother ride as the use of computers in attraction design was just beginning when the project was resumed. Big Thunder Mountain Railroad was one of the first Disney rides to utilize computer-aided design. Four of Disney's parks feature the attraction.

To mark the 100th anniversary of roller coasters in the US, Rolling Thunder's Coaster 2 side was renamed ""Rednuht Gnillor"", the backwards spelling of ""Rolling Thunder"", in 1984. The trains were turned around so that riders could view the ride while riding backwards. During this season, Rednuht Gnillor's warning signs were placed in the back of the station and on the back of the lift hill so that riders could see them.
Rolling Thunder did not operate from Fall 2005 through Spring 2006 due to construction of the ""Plaza del Carnival"" section of the park and the new El Toro roller coaster.

It was the 65m variant of the Schwarzkopf Wildcat model where small cars (each holding four passengers) take many tight turns and small hills that produce negative g-forces as well as strong lateral forces. Riders were required to be at least 48"" tall and be able to climb down vertical ladders in the case of an emergency evacuation. Riders were secured by a seatbelt and lap bar. At the end of the ride, riders were given a visual signal by the operator to extend their arms and hold on, as the train stops extremely quickly. It was the second Cedar Point ride to use the WildCat name following the 1970 installation, Wildcat, which was an identical 65m Schwarzkopf Wildcat.WildCat is the only roller coaster in Cedar Point that has been relocated since being built. WildCat had been in two previous places before settling in its final location, across from Iron Dragon. WildCat gave more than 25 million rides since its debut. Although this figure-8 designed coaster was a park favorite, ridership declined over the years from over 500,000 riders in 1996 down to 300,000 riders in 2008.On May 2, 2012, Cedar Point announced the permanent removal and dismantling of the WildCat roller coaster prior to the opening of the 2012 season for the expansion of Celebration Plaza.

It became the main attraction of the park, and led to attendance numbers doubling from 500,000 in 1979, to over 1,000,000 in 1980.  It was a Vekoma MK1200 Corkscrew with Bayern curve.  Weighing a total of 350 metric tons (340 long tons; 390 short tons), and built within a base area of 95 by 50 metres (312 by 164 feet), the modular steel track was painted yellow, whilst the steel supports were painted black.  Two trains of six cars (24 riders per train, four in each car) were a patriotic red, white, and blue, and the entry and exit station was blue and white.
In 1984, more attractions were built in the new 'Festival Park' along with Enterprise and the Twirling Toadstool (then Wave Swinger).When a newly themed area called Ug Land opened in 1999, Corkscrew's appearance was modified.  Its trains and track received a new paint scheme, and dinosaur-themed props were placed around the ride, including a dinosaur skeleton that guests would pass under in the waiting line queue.In 2005, a new roller coaster called Rita was built (originally known as Rita: Queen of Speed), as well as there being several other changes to the park.  This resulted in Corkscrew becoming dated, and eventually a decreasingly popular attraction of the park.  Customers also reported that due to its age, it had become increasingly bumpy and uncomfortable to ride.In October 2008, after 28 years of service, Alton Towers confirmed that the ride was to be dismantled at the end of the 2008 season, to make room for the 2010 attraction TH13TEEN, built under the codename Secret Weapon 6, or SW6.  On 9 November 2008, after carrying an estimated 43.5 million thrill-seeking passengers, Alton Towers held a special event in honour of the attraction in which the Corkscrew completed the final circuit of its 750 metres (2,460 feet) track.  The official date for the last day in regular service was 2 November 2008 - the last day of the season.After being dismantled, the section of track which formed the two corkscrew inversions was saved, and repainted blue and gold.

The expansion was reported to begin soon after its approval, with site preparation to take place first, and cost between $5 million to $10 million. Construction of the area entitled ""Timbuktu"" that would encompass the latter roller coaster was observed by The Tampa Tribune in November 1978.Anheuser-Busch announced a $12.3 million expansion to its Busch Gardens Tampa park for a new section named Timbuktu on February 5, 1979. The 7-acre (2.8 ha) addition would see the construction of several attractions, including a roller coaster entitled ""Scorpion"" which was described as ""a European designed roller coaster with a 360-degree-loop"". The Timbuktu expansion would open in two phases, with the Scorpion roller coaster to open as part of the latter-half at a later date. The original opening date was reported to be in December 1979, though, was moved back several times.The Timbuktu section of the park opened to guests on January 25, 1980. Construction of Scorpion was observed by the Orlando Sentinel in March 1980, with an opening that was due in May 1980. On May 16, 1980, Scorpion opened as the park's second roller coaster. In 2004, the Scorpion was repainted from its original paint scheme of orange track and black supports to red track with blue supports (a paint scheme similar to SheiKra).

Allen of the Philadelphia Toboggan Coasters (PTC). It is based on the first three roller coasters he designed shortly after becoming the company's president in 1954. These coasters opened in 1956 at Hunt's Pier, Angela Park and the Gooding Zoo (now the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium).  Allen modified the original design, making Woodstock Express a little taller and longer.  He eliminated the curved loading station as well, opting instead for an in-line station that precedes the curve to the lift hill.  This modified design was then used to build two nearly identical models at Kings Dominion and Carowinds. A third copy at Canada's Wonderland was also based on this design but is taller and slightly longer, and it was designed by Curtis D. Summers.The coaster was originally named Scooby Doo and opened with the park in 1972 as part of ""The Happy Land of Hanna-Barbera"".  Paying homage to The Beast after its successful launch in 1979, Scooby Doo was renamed The Beastie, and a tunnel was added to the bottom of its first drop in time for the 1980 season.  In 2006, a decision was made during the Nickelodeon Universe overhaul to remove the tunnel and rename it to Fairly Odd Coaster (based on the Nickelodeon TV show The Fairly OddParents). Although Cedar Fair had the rights to continue using the themes through 2016 following its purchase of the park in 2006, it was decided to remove all remaining Hanna-Barbera and Nickelodeon themes from the kids area in time for the start of the 2010 season. As a result, the ride went through another name change to Woodstock Express in line with the new Planet Snoopy makeover.Woodstock Express was awarded ACE Coaster Classic status, but that status has since been rescinded as a result of recent changes to the coaster.",,0,2 trains with 5 cars.

The attraction was built with approximately 1,360,000 feet (410,000 m) of lumber, 129,720 bolts, and 30,600 pounds (13,900 kg) of nails. Supports are attached to approximately 2,000 concrete footings that average 1.5 feet (0.46 m) in diameter and are 4.5 feet (1.4 m) deep. American Eagle was painted with over 9,000 US gallons (34,000 L; 7,500 imp gal) of white paint and took over 20,000 man hours to build. American Eagle was designed by Curtis D. Summers, James Figley, and Leonard Wright. Marriott originally contacted John C. Allen to design the coaster, but he did not want to attempt it.
American Eagle cost $10 million to construct and opened to the public on May 23, 1981.The tent that housed the American Eagle queue area from 1981 to 2006 was used as a circus tent from 1976 to 1980. In 2007, it was converted into a children's area named Kidzopolis (originally Wiggles World). The new entrance is located to the right of Kidzopolis, utilizing part of the entry building for the adjacent Dare Devil Dive skycoaster, which opened in 1997.

It was a concept the company coined as ""suspended"", and it was considered revolutionary at the time. Although the concept wasn't entirely new, with unsuccessful attempts of manufacturing suspended roller coasters dating back to the early 20th century, Arrow was able to utilize their tubular steel track technology to succeed where others failed. Tubular track was developed by Arrow during their partnership with Disneyland on Matterhorn Bobsleds, Arrow's first coaster which opened in 1959.The tubular design proved dependable and led to unique track designs that wooden coasters were incapable of. Following on the heels of their success with mine train coasters in the 1960s and looping steel coasters in the 1970s, Arrow believed the suspended coaster concept represented the next era for roller coasters. They built a working prototype at their facility in Mountain View, California, and invited Kings Island executives to visit and test ride in 1978. Prior to the opening of The Beast in 1979, Kings Island was already in the initial stages of planning their next major ride and had turned to Arrow for ideas. In turn, Arrow needed a financial partner to move past the concept phase and build the first full-scale, permanent installation. Kings Island gladly accepted and decided to invest in the new concept, supplying land and support from their in-house engineering department. Work on the new coaster began immediately, taking 18 months to plan and design before construction could begin.",August 1983,0,3 trains with 7 cars.

This change led to many problems with the local community. Environmentalists tried to get the building permit withdrawn, and the park's neighbors feared problems arising from growing visitor numbers. Because of the likely noise pollution, the highest court of public justice ordered the construction to be stopped. After some time, construction  recommenced, but legal problems continued for several more years.
In 1995, when operating hours were extended until 10 pm, the coaster's 45-decibel noise level became a problem once more. Plans were submitted to the local municipality, describing an extension and complete renovation of the coaster, which would reduce the noise substantially. Due to the high cost, the funds were allocated to the construction of a new enclosed (to reduce noise problems for the park's surroundings) roller coaster, 'Vogel Rok'.
Efteling hoped to get a night license for Python with some small renovations (new trains and a chain lift), but only with a change in the permit could Python remain open until 10 pm. 
In 2005 the trains were replaced by Kumbak Coasters designed by Karel Willemen and in December 2011 with Vekoma MK1212 trains.
In 2017 Efteling decided to rebuild the old coaster, because the quality of the steel was deteriorating. While the general layout remained the same, the track was redesigned to provide a smoother ride. In 2018 Efteling demolished the old track. The station, lift hill, first drop, and brake-run remained. The Belgian company CSM produced the new track. The ride reopened on the 31 March 2018.",,4,2 trains with 7 cars.

The new coaster was intended to be the top thriller in the park, billed as ""Taller than the park's most popular ride (Racer 75)"" and ""heaven for the real thrillseeker"". Grizzly was designed by Curtis D. Summers, and is very similar to Wilde Beast at Canada's Wonderland, which he designed a year earlier. Both coasters are based on the Wildcat roller coaster (demolished in 1964) at the early Coney Island park in Cincinnati, Ohio. Media conglomerate Taft Broadcasting owned Coney Island at the time. The layout placed the coaster in the Old Virginia section of the park, winding mostly through the existing forest for the first half, then entering a large infield (which also held an employee parking area) for the second. The ride opened on March 27, 1982, and was closed for portions of the 2009 and 2011 seasons for retracking.
Grizzly was given a refurbishment in 2016. The first and second hills were entirely retracked with fresh new wood and brand new running rails. Moreover, the station floor was completely redone. The old floor made out of laminated plywood sheets was replaced with fresh, sturdy wooden planks.After Labor Day 2022, Grizzly closed for major refurbishment by The Gravity Group. 1,040 feet of the ride was retracked to provide a smoother ride experience. The first drop was increased from 45 to 55 degrees and the fan turn after the tunnel was reprofiled to include a smoother transition. The ride's overall length was slightly increased by 12 feet (3.6 m) to 3,162 feet (964 m) and reopened on the 13th of May, 2023.",,0,2 trains with 7 cars.

The roller coaster was given a space theme and debuted at the park in 1983.In 1985, the bottom of the first drop was modified slightly to make the ride run more smoothly. Lights were also added to the lift, so that riders were able to brace themselves for the first drop. For the 1988 season, Black Hole was dismantled and transported to Europe, where it had an overhaul by BHS (later becoming Maurer Söhne) of Peißenberg in Germany, to accommodate dual-car trains. The reconstructed roller coaster reopened, and was briefly named Black Hole II in 1988, and then New Black Hole in 1989, before reverting to its original name.The opening of Oblivion in 1998 led to the redevelopment of Fantasy World, which became known as X-Sector. Black Hole underwent another refurbishment and was integrated into the new themed area. The colour scheme of the original tent was changed from yellow and green to a dark blue, and the entrance was revamped to reflect the X-Sector theme. Its interior was redesigned, featuring a modified queue layout and station, which were restyled with a Jules Verne theme.
In later years, the Black Hole became costly to maintain, and the park decided to close the attraction in 2005. The roller coaster track was dismantled and sold in 2007. There were no confirmed plans to reuse the site, and the tent remained unused for several years.
During a question-and-answer session in 2010 celebrating the opening of TH13TEEN, it was confirmed by John Wardley and then-marketing director Morwenna Angove that preparation for a new roller coaster in 2013 had begun, and that the former site of Black Hole was being considered for the location. A planning application for the Black Hole site was submitted in early 2012 and approved by Staffordshire Moorlands District Council. The large tent which housed the now former Black Hole was eventually dismantled in April 2012 to make way for The Smiler.",5 March 2005[1],0,,Dinosaur Land,The Smiler,,,42 in (107 cm),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ride was the second full-sized roller coaster to open at the park since its re-opening in 1940, following the installation of Thunderbolt in 1941. The $2.5 million Riverside Cyclone was designed by William Cobb & Associates and built by the Frontier Construction Company. The ride officially opened to the public on June 25, 1983, with Cobb as well as Norm Howells from Frontier Construction in attendance. The opening of Riverside Cyclone was expected to increase park attendance by more than 10% to 1 million annual visitors.During its first season of operation, Riverside Cyclone featured two trains from Philadelphia Toboggan Coasters (PTC) where riders were restrained via a lap bar. Part-way through the first season, shoulder belts were added; however, these were removed prior to its second season. During its second season, the ride's trains were damaged, forcing the park to combine parts from both trains to form a single operational train. Two new replacement trains were purchased from D. H. Morgan Manufacturing in 1985.

In the late 1990s, Premier Parks (later Six Flags) purchased Riverside Amusement Park. Over a period of four years, approximately $100 million was invested in the renovation and expansion of the park, culminating in its rebranding to Six Flags New England in 2000. As a result, the Riverside branding was dropped, with the ride being renamed to the Cyclone. The D.H. Morgan Manufacturing trains were replaced with two PTC trains. The new operators made modifications to the track in 2001, shortening the first drop by between 15 and 20 feet (4.6 and 6.1 m).A refurbishment of the Cyclone in 2011 saw Topper Track from Rocky Mountain Construction added to sections of the ride. Topper Track is steel plating that replaces the upper layers of laminated wooden track. This track style is designed to reduce the maintenance typically required for a wooden roller coaster and provide a smoother ride experience.",,3,2 trains with 6 cars.

Even though three-quarters of the new ride had been built, the ride was never completed, and was later completely scrapped. Busch Gardens then handed the contract to Arrow Dynamics. After the failure of The Bat at Kings Island, the company improved their suspended roller coaster concept with banked turns and brakes above the trains.
On November 10, 1983, Busch Gardens Williamsburg announced that they would be building a new Arrow suspended coaster. It would be named Big Bad Wolf and would open in 1984, along with XLR-8 at Six Flags AstroWorld in Houston, Texas. Big Bad Wolf was supposed to open on March 18, but its opening got delayed until June.
After Arrow Dynamics went bankrupt in 2002, spare parts for Big Bad Wolf became more expensive and harder to find. The forces of the ride often wore out the trains and track. The location, intensity and lack of spare parts made Big Bad Wolf harder to maintain. The park would have to replace millions of dollars worth in parts to keep it running, but repairing was far beyond their resources.On July 24, 2009, it was announced that the Big Bad Wolf would be retired after 25 years of operation. It officially closed on September 7, 2009. The ride vehicle, signage and safety rules sign were being donated to the National Roller Coaster Museum. The land once occupied by Big Bad Wolf was cleared afterwards to make room for the construction of Verbolten, a new roller coaster that opened at the park in 2012.While the Drachen Fire roller coaster was in operation from 1992 to 1998, guests waiting in its line queue could view the Big Bad Wolf's village-themed area of the ride, as the pathway was situated nearby and offered a viewing area. Access to the viewing area was closed following Drachen Fire's demise in 1998.

The park wanted a unique coaster design to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the first roller coaster in the United States, and a stand-up roller coaster design was selected. TOGO of Japan, which had previously modified other sit-down coasters into stand-up designs, was hired to build the attraction. It would become the first of its kind designed from the ground up as a stand-up model.The prototype, named Astro-Comet, was built and tested in the parking lot of TOGO's facility in Tokyo. It featured a 95-foot-tall (29 m) lift hill, a 66-foot-tall (20 m) vertical loop, a 540-degree helix, and a maximum speed of 50 mph (80 km/h). Kings Island purchased the prototype, and construction began in December 1983. Park guests were surveyed to help name the new coaster, settling on King Cobra. The new attraction, marketed as the world's first stand-up coaster, opened to the public on April 22, 1984.After the ride's manufacturer, TOGO, went out of business in 2001, parts for the ride became more expensive and harder to find. Following the 2001 season, Paramount Parks began to dismantle King Cobra and put it up for sale. The trains were stored inside the Flight of Fear building and the track in one of Kings Island's ""graveyards"" located on old Wild Animal Habitat land. When the ride didn't sell, the track was scrapped and the trains were relocated to Kings Dominion to be used as spare parts for Shockwave.","November 5, 2001",1,,,"SlingShot(2002-2021), Delirium, Banshee, Cargo Loco",,"3,000,000 USD",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, the coaster was located at Pontchartrain Beach and was named the Ragin’ Cajun.
Six Flags announced on March 3, 2016, that Steamin' Demon would be among several rides at various parks that would receive a virtual reality (VR) upgrade. Riders will have the option to wear Samsung Gear VR headsets, powered by Oculus, to create a 360-degree, 3D experience while riding. The illusion is themed to a fighter jet, where riders fly through a futuristic city as co-pilots battling alien invaders. The feature debuted on the coaster when it reopened in summer of 2016.

The seats have one lap bar for each row, as well as an individual seatbelt that attaches to the seat divider instead of the seat.

Built by Vekoma, it is thus far the only wild mouse coaster designed by this corporation. It was later moved to Alton Towers, an amusement park in Staffordshire, England. When it opened there in 1987, its  name was the Alton Mouse. The ride featured a covered lift hill there, which was used to conceal the treacherous curves at the top of the hill from patrons until they reached the top. The lift hill was also tilted, which suggests that the cover was a rotating tunnel, which with the tilting track, created the effect of going upside-down. The Alton Mouse was closed in 1992, partly because the harsh curve and braking system had diminished its popularity, but mainly because the area of the park it was located in was small and the ride was popular, causing congestion. Local residents also complained of the noise levels, so when the Alton Mouse was removed, so were the other rides in the area, which was closed off from the rest of the park.
In 1993, the Wild Mouse reopened at Idlewild. The track was originally painted a rust red with black supports when the ride first moved to Idlewild. Rough air brakes continued to hinder the ride until 2002, when a new, much smoother magnetic braking system was installed by Pribonics Technologies and the color scheme was changed to gray track, still with black supports.
The Wild Mouse features a traditional setup, including tight, unbanked curves and short but steep hills.  However, the ride's height is somewhat taller than that of the average wild mouse coaster and includes a somewhat rougher ride.The ride did not operate at all during the 2012 season.

Galaxi model.  However, on September 11, 1983, an incident on the coaster resulted in the fatal injury of 13-year-old Daniel Watkins. The incident was used as the primary example of unsafe rides in local press coverage of the concurrent U.S. Senate hearings on amusement ride safety and regulation. Rather than reopen the attraction, Kings Dominion dismantled and sold it, to the Myrtle Beach Pavilion where it operated until 1997 as the Galaxi.
In August 1985, Kings Dominion announced that they would be building a TOGO stand-up roller coaster to replace Galaxie. It would be named Shockwave. The station design was known for having a station floor that was not level, which tilted down toward the front where the train exited. This eliminated the need to propel trains as they dispatched from the station, instead relying on gravity to roll out of the station.
Shockwave opened to the public on March 23, 1986. On opening day, its wait times were two and a half hours long. This was one of the two stand-up coasters named Shockwave to open that year, with the other one being at Six Flags Magic Mountain which opened two months later on May 16. The latter coaster was relocated to Six Flags Great Adventure in 1990 and Six Flags AstroWorld three years later in 1993 as Batman The Escape.Shockwave became rougher over the years and its popularity began to decrease. Plus, the closure of TOGO's American offices in 2001 made getting spare parts much harder and expensive. After operating for nearly 30 years and accommodating over 22 million riders, Kings Dominion announced on July 9, 2015, that Shockwave would permanently close. Kings Dominion Vice President Pat Jones released a statement saying, ""While it’s bittersweet to say goodbye to one of our older coasters, we’re excited for what the future holds...We’re happy that Shockwave was able to provide close to three decades of memories.” The last rides on Shockwave were given on August 9, 2015. A week later on August 20, Kings Dominion announced that it would be replaced by Delirium for the 2016 season. Demolition of Shockwave began in November 2015.","August 9, 2015",1,2 trains with 6 cars.

The concept came from Baxter's work on fellow Imagineer Marc Davis's concept for the Western River Expedition, a western-themed pavilion at the Magic Kingdom, designed to look like an enormous plateau and contain many rides, including a runaway mine train roller coaster. However, because the pavilion as a whole was deemed too expensive in light of the construction and 1973 opening of Pirates of the Caribbean, Baxter proposed severing the mine train and building it as a separate attraction.
The Big Thunder Mountain Railroad project was put on hold again in 1974 as resources and personnel were being diverted to work on constructing Space Mountain in Tomorrowland, but this delay may have ultimately produced a smoother ride as the use of computers in attraction design was just beginning when the project was resumed. Big Thunder Mountain Railroad was one of the first Disney rides to utilize computer-aided design. Four of Disney's parks feature the attraction. It first opened at Disneyland in 1979, and then a larger version debuted at Magic Kingdom in Florida in 1980. Tokyo Disneyland's version opened in 1987. Disneyland Paris opened with its version in 1992, of which its layout and structure is primarily based on the Florida version of the ride. The Disneyland Paris installation is also the only Big Thunder Mountain to have been an opening-day attraction at its park.

(Riders can still spot the docking cleats welded to the dock while climbing the stairs to the boarding station.) The Monster circular ride used to call the land under Iron Dragon's transfer track home. Monster closed on Labor Day weekend in 1986 so Iron Dragon construction could begin. Planning for Iron Dragon began in 1985, the same year the Frontier Lift cable car ride (similar to the Sky Ride found on Cedar Point's main midway) opened for its final season.
In the early and mid-1990s, a ""remote a boat"" game was housed in the water under Iron Dragon's final helix element. This was removed in 1997.

After Portopialand closed in March 2006, the roller coaster was acquired by Camelot Theme Park and was dismantled and shipped to the United Kingdom. It cost the park £3 million to build the roller coaster. 
The track and trains arrived at Camelot at the end of 2006, without the mountain structure that initially enclosed it. At the beginning of 2007, the reconstruction began, with the ride finally opening to the public in the summer of 2007, as Knightmare. The coaster originally featured five different coloured trains. When relaunched at Camelot, the park refurbished three of the five trains. 
Some of the steam train theming was removed (such as the funnel and headlights) from the front of the trains. The three trains were painted differently with one being partly maroon, one partly purple and the other partly green. The other two trains were placed in storage at the park. Each train had a capacity of 14 people, and the ride had a minimum height restriction of 1.3 metres (4 ft 3 in).
The ride took the train up a semi spiral chain lift to its tallest point at 87 feet (27 m), then dropped the train into an overbanked turn. The ride then took passengers through various sharp turns, multiple helixes and a near-vertical bend (nicknamed ""the psycho drop"") halfway through where they experienced almost 5 g, reaching speeds of about 40 miles per hour (64 km/h).
The ride was over 0.5 miles (0.80 km) long, and lasted just under two minutes.

It had an Old Western theme, and featured an extensively themed area and queue, primarily designed by John Wardley, taking guests above buildings, around a lake and down into a small mine.
The coaster was originally designed to travel in and out of a cave feature, which enclosed half the track and hid much of the structure, creating an interacting rocky landscape. However, due to its semi-temporary construction and prolonged lack of maintenance over the years, the cave feature was removed in late 2012 and the ride closed.

In 2013, the area surrounding the Runaway Train was boarded off with notices up saying that the ride would be ""Re-launching in 2014"". Over the closed season, the animatronic scorpion was installed after 208 hours of off-site construction. During this downtime, the ride had all its original cave design, landscaping and theming features removed, now placing the track completely in the open and the queue on flat ground.
The ride was complete on time to open for the park's Annual Passholder Preview Days when it soft-opened.

For the design and construction of the attraction, Kings Island turned to Arrow Dynamics, an industry-leading manufacturer at the time. It would sit in the former location of The Bat, the world's first suspended roller coaster, which was removed after the 1984 season. The defunct coaster's line queue and train station were retained and reused for the new ride.Construction began in early June 1986 when The Bat's area was cleared. The following month, Kings Island announced that they would be naming the new coaster Vortex. The park invested over $4 million in the ride, which required 750 tons of steel to construct. It opened to the public on April 11, 1987, and helped the park exceed 3 million visitors for the first time in its history. At its inauguration, Vortex briefly set two world records among full-circuit roller coasters. It was the tallest at 148 feet (45 m) and featured the most inversions with six. Both were surpassed the following year with the debut of Shockwave at Six Flags Great America.On September 27, 2019, the park announced plans to close Vortex permanently on October 27, 2019. Area Manager Don Helbig stated that the coaster had reached the end of its service life. During its lifespan, Vortex accommodated over 46 million riders, ranking it seventh in Kings Island's history as of 2019.While Vortex was demolished, the trains were taken to Carowinds so that Carolina Cyclone could use them as replacement parts.On September 29, 2020, Kings Island announced that they would be selling pieces of Vortex for $198.70. The pieces would be sold in 1.5-inch slices, capped with metal plates and mounted in a display stand.","October 27, 2019",6,3 trains with 7 cars.

The attraction opened on May 21, 1988.
The coaster is located in the Samurai Summit area of Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia, California. Upon opening, Ninja was the fifth of the ten original Arrow suspended coasters. It is somewhat unusual in that it uses two lift hills — one at the beginning of the ride and a second one just before the end, to return the train to station elevation.
Ninja's station building previously served as the upper station for Six Flags Magic Mountain's Dragon tram. The tram carried passengers up and down the hillside until its closure in 1981, and its abandoned lower station can still be found near Jet Stream's station and Ninja's final brake run.
Ninja is the only Arrow Dynamics suspended coaster west of the Mississippi River. The other three suspended coasters in North America (Vortex at Canada's Wonderland, Iron Dragon at Cedar Point and The Bat at Kings Island) are all east of the Mississippi.
The station building is designed to resemble elements of Japanese architecture, and features several large renditions of classic Japanese woodblock prints of popular Kabuki actors of the Edo period, mostly by Tōshūsai Sharaku.
Soon after Six Flags Astroworld was shut down in 2005, the trains from their suspended XLR-8 were brought to Six Flags Magic Mountain to be used on Ninja.
Ninja received a fresh coat of paint for the 2007 season; the ride was repainted with bright red track and white supports.
In 2008, Six Flags Magic Mountain installed a new control system for Ninja.",,0,3 trains with 7 cars.

The park completed construction of Boomerang in early April. Boomerang opened on June 8, 2013.On May 6, 2016, one of the trains abruptly stopped mid-course causing minor injuries to four riders.

The coaster's station was located on land formerly occupied by the recently-installed Convoy ride, which was relocated to its current location in the park. In a move to match the Dragon's theme, the Riverview area of the park that the ride was built around was rechristened as Dragon Island.The Dragon made its debut on May 12, 1990, representing an estimated $2.1 - 2.5 million investment (worth $4–5 million in 2020). It was Adventureland's only coaster with inversions until The Monster opened in June 2016. While the coaster was fairly well-received by the public for several years, it would eventually begin to roughen up and gain a reputation for its shakiness and poor tracking. The outdated hardware and design would only be amplified by the installation of the more modern Monster in 2016. Overall, Dragon's condition had greatly deteriorated by the summer of 2019, which would end up becoming its last season of operation. The last remaining section of the ride was completely removed by 2022
On May 17, 2020, Adventureland began teasing a new attraction for the 2021 season named The Dragon Slayer, which was later revealed to be a replacement for the Dragon. The very next day, construction crews began the process of dismantling the Dragon, now confirmed to be permanently closed. Only the ride's defining pair of vertical loops were left standing as decoration, and were fitted with banners teasing the new Dragon Slayer coaster.","September 29, 2019",2,Single train with 7 cars.

The Texas investors who operated the park filed it for bankruptcy after only one season of operation. The Ed Hart-led Themeparks LLC firm purchased the rights to operate the park in 1989, reopening the park the following year. As part of the reopening the new operators added a collection of new rides including Thunder Run, which opened in August 1990. Early in Thunder Run's operating life, one of the cars uncoupled while climbing the lift hill and the ride's lap bars were found to be unsafe. No injuries were reported from these incidents. The original ride was retracked by Martin & Vleminckx prior to its closure in 2009.Thunder Run operated until the end of the 2009 season which ended on November 1. On February 4, 2010, amid a corporate bankruptcy, Six Flags closed the park due to the rejection of an amended lease by the Kentucky State Fair Board. Eventually, on June 27, 2013, a group of investors led by Ed Hart negotiated an agreement to reopen the park with a planned investment of $50 million. Rocky Mountain Construction was hired to refurbish the coaster, resulting in replacement of the existing wooden track. On October 10, 2013, Kentucky Kingdom invited members of the media and amusement industry to ride the refurbished Thunder Run. The ride reopened to the public on May 24, 2014. After the 2016 season, Kentucky Kingdom announced that Thunder Run would receive a new train from the Philadelphia Toboggan Company for the 2017 season.

Faced with the challenge of finding the necessary space, the park settled on a design from Arrow Dynamics. The concept featured a 160-foot (49 m) lift hill with a record-breaking 228-foot (69 m) drop, surpassing the previous 194.7-foot (59.3 m) record set two years earlier by Magnum XL-200 at Cedar Point. With a top speed of 80 mph (130 km/h), it was also set to become the world's fastest. Kennywood unveiled plans for the new ride, dubbed Steel Phantom, on July 27, 1990. Steel Phantom was built on the former site of Laser Loop, a Shuttle Loop coaster removed after the 1990 season. It also reused the Laser Loop's loading station.
Construction of Steel Phantom began during Labor Day weekend in early September 1990. It was set to open on May 4, 1991, but this would be delayed. The ride opened on May 10, 1991, setting new records in drop height and speed, as well as featuring four inversions. While the coaster was well-received and ranked frequently in the top 10 according to Kennywood, riders often complained of neck strain and excessive headbanging. Shortly after its debut, engineers found that the train would reach speeds exceeding specifications. The ride was closed for over a week so trim brakes could be installed prior to the inversions where the injuries were occurring.
On March 5, 2000, Kennywood announced that they would dismantle Steel Phantom. A replacement for Steel Phantom was not announced at the time. ""Just about anything is on the table"" said Kennywood spokeswoman, Mary Lou Rosemeyer. After the decision to remove Steel Phantom was announced, the park started receiving complaints and emails about the decision. Kennywood ultimately decided to keep the roller coaster but make modifications to it. On August 10, 2000, Kennywood announced that Steel Phantom would be transformed into Phantom's Revenge for the 2001 season. After the ride closed on Labor Day weekend in 2000, Steel Phantom underwent extensive changes by D. H. Morgan Manufacturing, most notably the removal of all of its inversions. The modified coaster reopened as Phantom's Revenge on May 19, 2001. The coaster only operated with one train in its first season. In 2002, magnetic brakes were added to the ride so a second train could be used. Because of the modifications, both Morgan style and Arrow style track have been utilized. A short theme tune used in television commercials for the attraction was composed by Jim DiSpirito, former member of Pittsburgh-based rock band Rusted Root.Kennywood hosted an online poll in September 2021, asking fans to decide whether Phantom's Revenge should be repainted teal or purple. Nearly 10,000 people participated in the poll, voting to repaint the track purple. The repainting started in October 2021.",,0 (4 in Steel Phantom),2 trains with 7 cars.

The ride soft opened to the public on May 2, 1992, with an official opening one week later on May 9. The ride cost $7 million to build. At the time, it was the single biggest investment made by Six Flags Great America on one attraction.Following the ride's success, then-parent company Time Warner devised an expansion plan to install clones of the original at the rest of the US parks in the Six Flags chain throughout the 1990s. In 1992, Six Flags Great Adventure announced the addition of Batman: The Ride in place of Lightnin' Loops. It opened to the general public on May 1, 1993. Six Flags Magic Mountain announced the addition of their installation on August 4, 1993. The attraction opened on March 26, 1994 as part of a new Gotham City Backlot section.On September 7, 1994, Six Flags St. Louis announced that they would be receiving their installation of Batman: The Ride. The attraction opened on April 22, 1995 and was the first location to be a flipped clone and feature a different queue line. Six Flags Over Georgia announced the ride in 1996 as part of a new Gotham City section, which became the largest investment in 30 years for the park. It opened for the first time on May 3, 1997.Six Flags Over Texas announced a copy of Batman: The Ride on November 4, 1998. The ride would sit next to Mr. Freeze, being located towards the back of the park in a new Gotham City area. Batman: The Ride made its debut at Six Flags Over Texas on May 26, 1999. This location features a unique loading station themed as the Wayne Foundation Industrial Park, unlike the others which are labeled Gotham Public Works. As new Batman films were being released, Six Flags St. Louis opened their installation to coincide with 1995's Batman Forever, while Six Flags Over Georgia debuted theirs to coincide with 1997's Batman & Robin.
In 2002, La Ronde in Montreal opened a mirror clone of the ride under the name Le Vampire (The Vampire). The name was the result of La Ronde, which is not a branded Six Flags park, lacking the necessary brand licensing agreement with Warner Bros. and DC Comics. It was expected to receive the Batman label when the park was scheduled to be converted to a Six Flags park in the mid-2000s, however, the plans were abandoned. Also in 2002, Warner Bros. Movie World Madrid opened another clone named Batman: La Fuga (Batman: The Escape).The final installation was constructed at Six Flags New Orleans in 2003, which was formerly located at Japanese amusement park Thrill Valley, where it operated as Gambit from 1995 to 2002. In 2005, the effects of Hurricane Katrina resulted in Six Flags abandoning the New Orleans park. The coaster remained abandoned for two years and was then relocated to Six Flags Fiesta Texas, where it was refurbished and repainted. The ride reopened as Goliath on April 18, 2008.From 2013 to 2015, the Batman: The Ride coasters at five locations operated backwards at different times throughout the three years.

In 1999, the roller coaster was renamed to Rollschuhcoaster, when Six Flags came as sole owners of the park.
In 2007, Six Flags released new entertainment and marketing initiatives for their US based parks, such as bringing Wiggles into their lineup. On September 28, 2008, Six Flags Fiesta Texas announced the expansion of Wiggles World, that would enhance the line up for family-oriented rides. Rollschuhcoaster was part of the expansion as the ride got refurbished with a new name, Romp Bomp A Stomp to go along with the theming of the new area.  
In November 2010, the company began the process of canceling licensed intellectual property deals they had with various brands including what they had with the Wiggles as the company was emerging itself from bankruptcy at that time. This affected the roller coaster in which, it was renamed in late 2010 as Kiddie Koaster. Ten years later in 2020, the roller coaster went through its fifth name change, to Streamliner Coaster. In 2023, the park announced that it's themed area DC Universe will expand into more of Spassburg and Thrill Seeker Park for the 2023 season. The expansion will have the roller coaster to go through another rethemed to fit with the area. In 2024, the roller coaster will be themed to the DC Comics character, Batgirl.

The planned acquisition would see the transfer of four theme parks owned or operated by the Kings Entertainment Company under the Paramount brand, which included Great America. Paramount was one of several entertainment companies that would acquire or purchase stakes in amusement parks to expand live entertainment opportunities and promote films. It was expected Paramount would develop rides based on films and franchises such as Top Gun, Star Trek, or The Addams Family.Great America became Paramount's Great America under the newly formed Paramount Parks, which planned to expand thematic elements in their park, including the addition of a Top Gun attraction to open in March 1993. The Top Gun attraction would be a steel inverted roller coaster, have a length of 2,260 ft (690 m), and feature an elaborate themed queue. Construction on the station was underway in January 1993. Top Gun later opened with the park on March 20, the first operating season under Paramount and the 18th for Great America. Top Gun was one of several movie-inspired attractions to open during the 1993 season, which included Batman: The Ride at Six Flags Great Adventure, Jaws at Universal Studios Florida, and Back to the Future: The Ride at Universal Studios Hollywood. After Paramount sold off Great America to Cedar Fair in 2006, the Top Gun theming was removed and the name changed to Flight Deck.",,3,2 trains with 7 cars.

The ride would have taken guests through wild jungles, around the lost temple and inside a large showbuilding for the mine chase scenes.  Rumours often circulate of other attractions to have been included in the area, such as Disneyland's EMV (enhanced motion vehicle) Indiana Jones Adventure and a new Jungle Exploration attraction based on the classic Jungle Cruise.Ultimately, the constrained budgets and requirement for a high-thrill attraction (at this point, Space Mountain was still 2–3 years away) brought the birth of Indiana Jones et le Temple du Péril, a looping coaster produced by Intamin of Switzerland. Giovanola is subcontractor. Despite lacking an indoor show building and the same scale as its ""blue sky"" predecessor, the final attraction stays true to the heavy theming of the original plans, with enough landscaping, winding paths and lush vegetation.The Temple du Péril was the first roller coaster in a Disney theme park with an inversion. It also has the highest height requirement of any Disney theme park attraction worldwide, though it is no longer the most intense. The ride is recommended for riders size 55"" (140 cm), presumably making it Disney's first thrill roller coaster for over size 50"".

However, Paramount took over operations in time to determine the ride's theme which was based on the Paramount Pictures film Top Gun.  On November 11, 1992, Kings Island announced that a new roller coaster named Top Gun would be added to the park. The ride would be an Arrow Dynamics suspended coaster, very similar to The Bat which had operated at the park in the 1980s. Construction of Top Gun began in December 1992 and was completed in early spring 1993. The park hired John DeCuir Jr., a production designer who worked on the film, to design the ride's loading platform, so that it would resemble the deck of an aircraft carrier. Top Gun opened on April 9, 1993.
Top Gun was renamed Flight Deck in 2008, two years after Cedar Fair purchased the park. The theme music and signage were changed to remove all references to the film. Cedar Fair had rights to continue using the Top Gun movie theme through 2016 but made the decision to remove all Paramount themes from the park much sooner.

The tubular track and supports were airlifted from Bolton to Blackpool and stored at nearby Blackpool Airport. During the start of the construction of the ride, the south of Blackpool promenade was closed and pieces of the structure were stored on the road adjacent to the Pleasure Beach. The first pieces to be fitted were the large foundations that would follow on from the main supports. Once all the supports were fitted, the tubular track was fitted followed by additional supports on the turnaround and the mid-course brake section.The roller coaster opened as the Pepsi Max Big One on 28 May 1994. At the time, it was both the tallest and steepest roller coaster in the world. Its height record was surpassed in 1996 by Fujiyama at Fuji-Q Highland in Japan. The Big One also features one of the longest tracks in the world with its out-and-back roller coaster layout, which measures over a mile in length at 5,497 feet (1,675 m). Each train reaches a maximum speed of 74 mph (119 km/h), which at the time of opening ranked second in the world behind Steel Phantom at Kennywood.The ride maintained its sponsorship from Pepsi Max until 2011 when the branding was removed from the ride. The Pepsi Max ride tunnel shaped like a drink can still remains as part of the ride.
The Big One has been partially re-tracked by Taziker over four recent closed seasons. In 2019-20, four sections of track were replaced in the section which passes through the Big One lift hill. The following year, a further 75m of track was replaced towards the end of the ride. In 2021-22, another 103m of track was replaced, from partway over Star Hill through the Big Dipper and into the mid-course brake. Following this, a further 103m of track was replaced on dip 4 over winter 2022-23.",,0,3 trains with 5 cars.

Primm contracted Arrow Dynamics to build a highly visible roller coaster. The ride opened to the public on August 11, 1994, as one of the tallest and fastest roller coasters in the world. The ride's 209-foot-tall (64 m) lift hill was the tallest in the world, second behind only the Pepsi Max Big One at Blackpool Pleasure Beach in England that opened the same year. Its drop length of 225 feet (69 m) and top speed of 80 mph (130 km/h) were tied in the country with Kennywood's Steel Phantom, which also featured a 225-foot (69 m) drop and top speed of 80 mph (130 km/h). The Guinness Book of World Records recognized Desperado in its 1996 publication as the tallest roller coaster in the world.For his Top Secret special that first aired on February 24, 1999, magician Lance Burton staged a death-defying escape in a stunt where he was tied to the roller coaster's track and had to break out of handcuffs in order to escape.In February 2020, due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Buffalo Bill’s Casino was temporarily closed, along with Desperado and their log flume which closed indefinitely. The casino reopened on December 23, 2022, but Desperado remained closed. In 2023, it was reported that the roller coaster would be part of a casino-wide refurbishment, in an effort to bring back previous guests. Casino general manager Jerry West stated that the ride had been kept properly maintained and functional during the nearly three-year closure, with test runs occurring regularly. He added that the coaster will be subject to a ""sign-off process"" involving legal and mechanical inspections before reopening.",,0,3 trains with 5 cars.

This new area would feature a variety of restaurants and stores. In addition, the centerpiece attraction would be a wooden roller coaster named ""Hurler"". It was billed as the first movie-themed wooden roller coaster in the United States. That same month, Kings Dominion announced that they would be getting their own Wayne's World section and a Hurler clone.Both installations of Hurler opened in 1994. The Kings Dominion location first opened for a special preview on April 28, 1994. On hand for the coaster's inaugural ride were Wayne and Garth impersonators, as well as Tia Carrere, who played Wayne's love interest Cassandra Wong in the films. Less than two months later on June 4, the Carowinds location would officially open to the general public. The coasters originally borrowed their theme from the films, whose main characters frequently used the word ""hurl"". Paramount sold both parks in 2006, and new owner Cedar Fair retained the name but removed references to Wayne's World.
During the 2013-2014 off-season, the Carowinds installation received a retracking from Great Coasters International. Hurler closed again for part of the 2014 season for regular maintenance. In March 2016, a ""closure"" notice was posted on the park's website and published on the park map indicating that the ride would not operate at all throughout the season. The website cited ""extensive maintenance"" as the reason.A video released in October 2016 on Kings Dominion's Facebook page announced that their Hurler was closing permanently, showing a headstone with its name and years of operation (1994–2016). The video ended with a teaser stating: ""for now"", indicating it may be refurbished and reopened. In August 2017, the park confirmed that Hurler would re-emerge in 2018 as a hybrid roller coaster called ""Twisted Timbers"".

The Midway Carousel and Calypso were relocated in October to other areas of the park to make room for Raptor. Footers also began to be poured that month. The lift hill was topped off in December with track construction continuing through January 1994. The first trains were tested about two months later in March. Final preparations were made in March with the entrance plaza being built and 85,000 square feet (7,900 m2) of midway replaced. Media day was held on May 6 before the ride opened to the public the next day for the first time. The ride was originally painted with dark green supports, bright green track and unpainted rails.

In 2007, when PARC Management bought the park from Six Flags, Warner Bros. was dropped from the park. With the removal of the Looney Tunes theme, the ride was renamed to Tombstone Tumbler. Then in 2008 the park renamed the ride to Cactus Coaster.In late 2012, Cactus Coaster was removed from Elitch Gardens and was transported to replace a coaster at Frontier City, Wild Kitty which operated from 1995-2012.

In 1985 it was relocated to Funland Park in Folkestone, Kent, where it was renamed Super Figure Eight. In 1995 it moved to Pleasurewood Hills as Cannonball Express, where it was mine train themed. In 2005 it was refurbished and renamed Enigma. In 2017 the name reverted to Cannonball Express.
As Cannonball Express, the ride originally had four trains coloured:

Blue   - Still in operation
Purple - In storage (Used for maintenance)
Green  - In storage (put on track in 2009 for a short time)
Red    - Used the least, thought to be scrappedThere is now only 1 train in operation, which seats only eight people. With separate on- and off-loading stations it means the ride has a very low capacity of around 160 people per hour.
The reason the other trains were retired was due to maintenance difficulties as the Schwarzkopf company, who manufactured the ride, stopped roller coaster production. The block brakes which allowed more than one train to run are now inoperative and the other trains have been cannibalised for parts.

The ride is themed heavily after the movie with various props alongside the line-up including models of the F-14 aircraft, hangars, radar installations, army trucks and informational posters about the making of the movie. Since its early inception, the ride was known as the flagship ride in the park, finally losing that distinction to Behemoth in 2008.
When Vekoma announced the 689m Standard Suspended Looping Coaster, Paramount had cancelled their plans with Bolliger & Mabillard (B&M) to make an inverted coaster to go on the land where Behemoth currently stands on due to Cedar Point's contract on having no B&M inverted coaster in the 321.9 kilometres (200.0 mi) radius of a Cedar Fair park. Because Canada's Wonderland was situated 318.6 kilometres (198.0 mi) from Cedar Point, the custom inverted coaster was cancelled and the SLC was put in place. The ride was built where ""Zumba Flume"" (a water log ride) was once located. The ""Top Gun"" movie theme was a shift in the design of the park. The ride no longer was themed to match the ""land"" in which it was situated.  The ride was renamed Flight Deck in 2008, following the park's sale to Cedar Fair.",,5,2 trains with 10 cars.

Wintrode worked with Walter Bolliger and Claude Mabillard – from Swiss roller coaster manufacturer Bolliger & Mabillard – along with engineer Robert Mampe to develop Batman: The Ride which opened at Six Flags Great America in 1992. Dutch amusement ride manufacturer Vekoma developed a similar concept shortly after, and the model became known as the Suspended Looping Coaster (SLC). Their first installation was El Condor at Walibi Holland which debuted in 1994.In 1995, nine parks around the world announced plans to add Vekoma SLCs, including Kentucky Kingdom. On December 1, 1994, Kentucky Kingdom announced that they would be adding a Vekoma SLC named T2. This one was identical to the original prototype at Walibi Holland, but it featured a different color scheme – red track with purple trains. T2 would officially open on April 8, 1995.

At the end of 1997, the rights to operate Kentucky Kingdom were sold to Premier Parks for $64 million. Following the acquisition, Batman and DC Comics themes were added to Kentucky Kingdom. As a result, T2 was painted black for the 1999 season. This was due to a plan by Six Flags to retheme part of the park as Gotham City, and rebrand T2 as Batman: The Ride and its next door roller coaster, Chang, as Riddler's Revenge. However, these plans never came to fruition, while T2 retained its new coat of black paint.Amid a corporate bankruptcy on February 4, 2010, Six Flags announced the park would cease operations immediately due to the rejection of an amended lease by the Kentucky State Fair Board. Under the efforts of former Kentucky Kingdom operator Ed Hart and several investors, the Kentucky Kingdom Redevelopment Company was formed to redevelop the park and reopen it. The Koch Family, owners of Holiday World & Splashin' Safari in Santa Claus, Indiana, also expressed interest in redeveloping the park. On February 23, 2012, the Kentucky Fair Board approved a lease agreement which would see the park reopen as Bluegrass Boardwalk. The plans called for the removal of T2 along with the Twisted Twins, due to age and safety concerns. However, plans soon unraveled, and the Koch family eventually withdrew from the investment.On June 27, 2013, Ed Hart's investment group negotiated an agreement to spend $36 million to reopen the park under its former name Kentucky Kingdom in 2014. Plans involved a major refurbishment of T2 with a timeline to reopen the ride in 2015. Later, it was revealed that the coaster would be renamed T3. The refurbished ride reopened on July 3, 2015, featuring renovated trains and track to provide a more comfortable experience for riders.On June 2, 2018, T3 had a minor accident as the second train bumped into the first train, which was waiting to enter the station for unloading. Five people were injured, with one being taken to the hospital. The coaster was closed for an investigation of the incident. The ride reopened two days later. T3 closed permanently following the 2022 season.","October 30, 2022",5,2 trains with 7 cars.

A new section called Frontier Adventures was among the changes, which combined the ""Best of the West"" and ""Hernando's Hideaway"" areas. Prior to the change, this section of the park previously housed Ultra Twister, the first pipeline roller coaster to open in the United States, which was removed in 1989 and relocated to Six Flags AstroWorld. Ultra Twister's manufacturer, TOGO, took the extraordinary step of building a full-scale prototype of a new coaster model and premiering it at their testing facility in Ohio. The prototype model introduced a new element that TOGO called the ""dive loop"", which contained a unique inline twist maneuver at the top of a vertical loop. Six Flags Great Adventure bought into the concept and hired TOGO to build one in the former location of Ultra Twister.Time Warner originally wanted the new ride to be based on the 1992 Clint Eastwood film Unforgiven, but the theme didn't perform well during market research. Six Flags ultimately chose the name Viper to pair its snake-like branding with the western-themed Frontiers Adventures. During construction, which began near the end of the 1994 season, officials asked TOGO to install additional steel rings on the lift hill and first drop to enhance its snake-like appearance. Throughout the queue, aged western props and other western-themed elements were added to give it a ghost town appearance. A steel structure left behind from the removal of Ultra Twister was covered with a rustic wood frame and placed near Viper's entrance.Viper opened to the public on June 2, 1995, and cost an estimated $4 million to construct. Despite a warm reception, it was plagued with maintenance issues and extensive downtime over the years. Coupled with ride quality issues and gaining a reputation for being extremely rough, guest satisfaction quickly declined. The hourly capacity of the ride also suffered from its confusing boarding and unloading procedure, where guests entered and exited on the same side inside the station. In addition, the combination over-the-shoulder and lap restraint system also proved to be cumbersome, resulting in slow loading times.In 1998, Viper was closed for most of the season, as Six Flags was having difficulty procuring replacement parts needed for maintenance. Behind the scenes, TOGO was struggling financially from the fallout of the company's highly-unsuccessful Windjammer Surf Racers, which opened at Knott's Berry Farm in 1997. The overall track design was also a factor in many of the ride's issues, with joints along the track unable to properly handle the stress from the trains. Sections of track were rewelded often and sometimes replaced altogether.Following sporadic operation over several years, Viper did not open with the park in 2001 and remained closed indefinitely for the rest of the year. It was subsequently removed from the park's promotional materials and maps. TOGO filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy that same year and shuttered their American offices. Six Flags considered removing Viper altogether and replacing it with an attraction from another park, but they were unsuccessful finding one that would properly fit its footprint. They pushed forward with modifications to the trains and track, and the coaster reopened to the public on March 29, 2002. The modifications failed to resolve ongoing issues, however, and Viper was down to one operating train by 2004. That season would prove to be its last, and the roller coaster was demolished in June 2005. They kept the station intact and repurposed it for El Toro, a record-breaking and well-received wooden coaster that opened in 2006.","September 6, 2004",2,3 trains with 4 cars.

Throughout the years, Viper's queue has undergone numerous modifications to accommodate additions such as the addition of Raging Bull directly south of the ride and the former entrance to the adjacent Hurricane Harbor water park directly west of the ride. Unlike most clones of the Coney Island Cyclone, Viper provides a much smoother ride than the original attraction.
During its first year of operation, Viper was part of Hometown Square. With the opening of Southwest Territory in 1996, Viper was officially made part of Southwest Territory, where it and Raging Bull are the anchor attractions.

Also that year, Knott's Berry Farm opened Montezooma's Revenge and Six Flags AstroWorld opened Greezed Lightnin' as the first installations to feature the flywheel launch system. A number of installations followed across the world.

In mid-August 1995, Kings Island officially announced more details revealing that their new-for-1996 attraction would be an indoor roller coaster named ""The Outer Limits: Flight of Fear"". Reaching a top speed of 54 mph (87 km/h) in only four seconds, it was originally described as utilizing a ""laser-controlled catapult system"" that would propel riders through a series of inversions in the dark. The experience would be ""heightened by Hollywood-type special effects"", according to Carolyn Boof who was the park's manager of marketing communications. Boof also confirmed it would cost significantly more than the $7 million that was cited in earlier reports, and that its alien theme would be based on the 1960s science-fiction TV series, The Outer Limits. Later, reports confirmed a site being renovated in Coney Mall on the back side of The Racer. The new ride would sit on some of the land formerly occupied by the Wild Animal Habitat. The rest of the former spot was used for other new attractions, including Son of Beast, Xtreme Skyflyer and Thunder Alley. On January 13, 1996, Flight of Fear was previewed at the 16th annual Non Coaster-thon Coaster Conference in Chicago.Premier Rides and park engineers performed the first successful launch at the Kings Dominion location on the evening of April 11, 1996, proving that linear induction motors could produce enough force through the use of magnetic fields to quickly accelerate roller coasters. Each launch required 3 megawatts of electric power, which caused frequent voltage sags to neighboring utility customers. Square D by Schneider Electric was hired to develop a complex solid-state capacitor bank which solved the sagging issue by reducing the load on the local electric utilities.Flight of Fear was originally scheduled to open in April 1996, but it was later delayed until June. Both park installations opened to the public on June 18, 1996, setting a world record among roller coasters for fastest acceleration. A media preview event was held the previous day. The attraction was awarded several top honors at the 1995 International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions trade show.Paramount Parks filed a lawsuit against Premier Rides in September 1996 regarding cost overruns during development and construction. Premier spokeswoman Courtney Simmons said in November 1997 that the absence of LIM technology in the original plans was a factor, and that the suit was essentially about money. It was later settled, and Premier expected to continue working with Paramount in future endeavors. After a lease agreement that allowed Paramount to license the sci-fi TV series expiried, The Outer Limits was dropped from the name in 2001 at both locations.The Kings Island installation was constructed in a small subsection of Coney Mall. After the addition of Firehawk in 2007, the area was named X-Base, themed to space and the paranormal. Flight of Fear was one of the two attractions that made their Winterfest debut in 2018, with the other one being Shake, Rattle & Roll, the park's Troika flat ride. The ride was dubbed as Flight of Cheer and featured Christmas decorations. Following Kings Island's August 2019 announcement of Orion, a new roller coaster replacing Firehawk, it was revealed that X-Base would be overhauled and renamed Area 72. For the 2020 season, Flight of Fear's entrance at Kings Island was updated with an extended outdoor line queue, which provides guests with view of Orion. A security van, a meteor and a fence were placed in front of the building. The exit area was improved with a new photo booth.",,4,4 trains with 5 cars.

Even initially, Stratosphere guests exhibited considerably greater excitement over the Big Shot gravity drop tower than they did over High Roller.As with the other rides at the Stratosphere Las Vegas, admission to the High Roller was typically charged per ride, as opposed to a single pass that allowed for unlimited rides as is typically the case in most United States amusement parks.

Officials agreed not to enforce an 80-foot (24 m) height limit and the park had dropped two lawsuits.At the time, the park had just been sold to Premier Parks. Geauga Lake's new owner would spend $9 million on attractions for the 1996 season. Two rides would open that year, with one being a Vekoma Boomerang coaster named The Mind Eraser and the other being an Intamin river rapids ride named Grizzly Run.The Mind Eraser originally had a turquoise track and white supports. In 2004, Geauga Lake was sold to Cedar Fair and the coaster was renamed to Head Spin.After Geauga Lake closed in 2007, Head Spin remained standing but was inactive in 2008. Later that year, an announcement stated that Head Spin would be relocated to Carowinds, where it reopened as Carolina Cobra on March 28, 2009. It was built in an area of the park called ""County Fair"", which was formerly housed by Flying Super Saturator, a roller coaster that was dismantled after the 2008 season.
On August 18, 2016, Carowinds announced the expansion of County Fair for the 2017 season, which included the refurbishment of Carolina Cobra. It was renamed The Flying Cobras to pay tribute to the classic air shows that were once seen at the Carolina County Fair. It also received a new paint scheme with blue track and white supports.","September 16, 2007",3 (each traversed twice),Single train with 7 cars.

To develop the idea, Wintrode worked with Walter Bolliger and Claude Mabillard—from Swiss roller coaster manufacturer Bolliger & Mabillard—and engineer Robert Mampe to develop Batman: The Ride which opened in May 1992.In early 1995, planning began for Montu, fourteen months prior to the ride opening to the public. The owners of Busch Gardens Tampa Bay, Busch Entertainment (since renamed SeaWorld Entertainment), entered into an agreement with Bolliger and Mabillard which would see them add Montu to Busch Gardens Tampa Bay in 1996, followed in 1997 by the additions of Alpengeist at Busch Gardens Williamsburg and The Great White at SeaWorld San Antonio.On August 23, 1995, Busch Gardens Tampa announced that they would be getting a new Egypt section. The area would cover 7 acres (2.8 ha) of land and feature a few attractions, including Tut's Tomb and the centerpiece attraction being a new Bolliger & Mabillard inverted roller coaster. It would be the first inverted roller coaster to feature seven inversions, as well as being the first roller coaster to feature an Immelmann loop. Besides this, the ride would be the first Bolliger & Mabillard coaster to feature a boomerang element, which debuted on Orient Express at Worlds of Fun in 1980. The Egypt section would be the largest and most expensive investment in Busch Gardens Tampa's history. On October 30, the park announced that they would be naming their new coaster Montu. On May 16, 1996, Montu officially opened to the public. At the time of its opening to the public, the ride was the tallest and fastest inverted roller coaster in the world.For the 2022 season, Montu was repainted with a darker navy blue track and yellow supports.",,7,3 trains with 8 cars.

In the days following the announcement, there was some negative reaction from the public regarding the term Banshee, which in the dictionary is described as a female spirit that warns of an impending family death. On November 14, 1995, Cedar Fair Entertainment Company filed a trademark for the name Mantis, which later became the ride's official name. As a result of the name change, its logo was also changed to resemble a mantis.

In 2011, the ride was rethemed from Cheetah Chase to Sand Serpent. This was done to reduce confusion with the park's new attraction, Cheetah Hunt. The roller coaster is situated in the Pantopia section of the park, which was renamed with the introduction of Falcon's Fury, the park's signature drop tower. Busch Gardens announced in June 2023 that Sand Serpent would close the next month for a new attraction. Sand Serpent closed on July 9, 2023.",,,,Crazy Camel,,,,,,28°02′19″N 82°25′21″W﻿ / ﻿28.038523°N 82.422389°W,37°14′06″N 76°38′42″W﻿ / ﻿37.235°N 76.645°W,Removed,Removed,"February 28, 2004","April 12, 1996",28°02′19″N 82°25′21″W﻿ / ﻿28.038523°N 82.422389°W,37°14′06″N 76°38′42″W﻿ / ﻿37.235°N 76.645°W,Removed,Removed,"February 28, 2004","April 12, 1996",,"July 9, 2023",2003,"July 9, 2023",2003,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Pantopia,Oktoberfest,Pantopia,Oktoberfest,,,,Phoenix Rising,Curse of DarKastle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Phoenix Rising,Curse of DarKastle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its last fair was the Hamburger Dom of November/December 1997, after which it was taken to the now-defunct Six Flags AstroWorld in Houston, Texas.
It was assembled at Six Flags AstroWorld in Houston late in 1997. The roller coaster opened at Six Flags AstroWorld on March 14, 1998 and was renamed Texas Tornado. This coaster had very positive reviews from guests but when summer hit, the heat and humidity seemed to disrupt operation. On very hot days the coaster suffered a lot of downtime. ""Texas Tornado"" continued to operate there in the 1999 and 2000 seasons with a lot of downtime on the hotter days. It seemed to run decently on milder and cooler days. At the end of the 2000 season, Six Flags decided to remove the ride but it stayed at AstroWorld, standing but not operating, for the 2001 season. Early in 2002, it was moved out of Six Flags AstroWorld and into storage.
In 2003, Texas Tornado was moved to Six Flags Discovery Kingdom and some track modifications were made by Premier Rides. The most significant was increasing the elevation of the first two loops. The effect of this change would be reducing the Thriller's top speed and lowering the g-forces during the first two loops. It was assumed that the mild weather would enable the coaster to run better. It was then renamed Zonga.
Zonga then operated for two years at Marine World. Unfortunately, operation continued to be inconsistent. Zonga regularly opened about two hours after the park and had frequent breakdowns. The ride wasn't very attractive because of its location (in a distant corner and hidden behind Roar) and appearance. There have been many malfunctions, which eventually led to Six Flags again closing down the ride. There have also been many complaints about the ride being rough. The ride ran for much of the 2004 season but stood silent for the 2005 season and was removed at the beginning of the 2006 season, leaving a large empty concrete area at the front of the park. Zonga was disassembled and moved to the Discovery Kingdom parking lot where it sat throughout the 2006 season. The new coaster for 2008—Tony Hawk's Big Spin, now known as Pandemonium since 2011. Pandemonium was erected on the pad that Zonga used to occupy. In 2012, another new ride replaced Pandemonium, Superman: Ultimate Flight. Zonga's former station was reused as an extended queue area and a PLC room for its successors.
Zonga was then bought in 2008 by the Aguascalientes State government in Mexico, for its use in the famous San Marcos National Fair, where it has been renamed ""Tsunami"".",,,,,,,,55 in (140 cm),,21°51′34″N 102°19′11″W﻿ / ﻿21.8595°N 102.3197°W,38°08′19″N 122°13′52″W﻿ / ﻿38.1386°N 122.2310°W,Removed,Removed,"April 27, 2008","April 25, 2003",29°40′30″N 95°24′24″W﻿ / ﻿29.6750°N 95.4068°W,59°19′22″N 18°05′46″E﻿ / ﻿59.3227°N 18.0961°E,Removed,Removed,"March 14, 1998",1996,,"November 9, 2014",2004,2000,1996,,,,,,,,,,21°51′34″N 102°19′11″W﻿ / ﻿21.8595°N 102.3197°W,38°08′19″N 122°13′52″W﻿ / ﻿38.1386°N 122.2310°W,Removed,Removed,"April 27, 2008","April 25, 2003",29°40′30″N 95°24′24″W﻿ / ﻿29.6750°N 95.4068°W,59°19′22″N 18°05′46″E﻿ / ﻿59.3227°N 18.0961°E,21°51′34″N 102°19′11″W﻿ / ﻿21.8595°N 102.3197°W,Removed,Removed,Removed,"March 14, 1998",1996,"April 27, 2008",,,,,38°08′19″N 122°13′52″W﻿ / ﻿38.1386°N 122.2310°W,Removed,"April 25, 2003",Pandemonium,Swat,29°40′30″N 95°24′24″W﻿ / ﻿29.6750°N 95.4068°W,59°19′22″N 18°05′46″E﻿ / ﻿59.3227°N 18.0961°E,21°51′34″N 102°19′11″W﻿ / ﻿21.8595°N 102.3197°W,38°08′19″N 122°13′52″W﻿ / ﻿38.1386°N 122.2310°W,29°40′30″N 95°24′24″W﻿ / ﻿29.6750°N 95.4068°W,Removed,Removed,Removed,Removed,Removed,"March 14, 1998",1996,"April 27, 2008","April 25, 2003","March 14, 1998","November 9, 2014",2004,2000,1996,Pandemonium,Swat,59°19′22″N 18°05′46″E﻿ / ﻿59.3227°N 18.0961°E,,,,,Removed,,,,,1996,,,,,"November 9, 2014",2004.0,2000.0,1996.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"November 9, 2014",2004,2000.0,1996.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was named after the mascot of the 1996 Summer Olympics, since Busch Gardens was a sponsor of the games. Originally in January, it was reported that Wild Izzy would open later in March. Though in March, the roller coaster was announced to open in April. Wild Izzy officially opened on April 12. After the 1996 season, it was given a European theme and renamed to Wilde Maus.In November 2003, filings by the park for a new attraction were uncovered in James City County that would replace the Wilde Maus roller coaster. After seven years of operation at Busch Gardens Williamsburg, the roller coaster closed in 2003 where it was removed and replaced with the defunct dark ride, Curse of DarKastle in 2005. In December 2003, the St. Petersburg Times reported that the Wilde Maus would be shipped to Busch Gardens Tampa Bay in January 2004 and be renamed to Cheetah Chase. The roller coaster opened on February 28, in the Timbuktu section of the park.Cheetah Chase replaced the defunct Crazy Camel flat ride that opened up with the Timbuktu section of the park in 1980. In 2011, the ride was rethemed from Cheetah Chase to Sand Serpent. This was done to reduce confusion with the park's new attraction, Cheetah Hunt. The roller coaster is situated in the Pantopia section of the park, which was renamed with the introduction of Falcon's Fury, the park's signature drop tower. Busch Gardens announced in June 2023 that Sand Serpent would close the next month for a new attraction.

It was themed after DC Comics' Batman rival, Harvey Dent A.K.A. Two-Face.In 2002, HangOver at Liseberg closed and was relocated to Allou Fun Park the following year. The ride, however, was never set up there and was relocated to Sommerland Syd where it operated under the name Tornado from July 2, 2005.An accident in October 2007 closed Two Face: The Flip Side at Six Flags America indefinitely.

In 2008, Face/Off at Kings Island was renamed to Invertigo following the park's initiative to remove Paramount themes from the park after being sold to Cedar Fair two years prior.On January 27, 2011, California's Great America announced that Invertigo would be removed from the park and relocated to a different Cedar Fair park.

It opened to the public on March 26, 1997. Windjammer experienced mechanical issues early on. Within a few weeks of operation, the ride needed several major repairs costing over $2 million. It also quickly gained a negative reputation for being rough, as the over-the-shoulder restraints lacked padding. The racing coaster would also frequently stall in reportedly ""slight breezes"".In 1999, an apparel company challenged the coaster's name, which was temporarily changed to Jammer until the dispute was resolved. In 2000, Knott's Berry Farm filed a lawsuit against the manufacturer, TOGO, suing for $17 million in damages. Knott's reported problems including misaligned and poorly designed tracks, defective safety restraints, and wrinkles in the main frame of the trains. The park also alleged that the ride's design flaws prevented operation during medium winds, sometimes stalling even during slight breezes, which Knott's called an ""embarrassment."" The ride remained closed during the lawsuit as evidence, but Knott's was unable to complete a sale of the ride. TOGO shut their American offices down in March 2001 after filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.In June 2001, the park erected construction walls surrounding Windjammer Surf Racers, and the nearby Headspin scrambler ride was relocated. Windjammer was demolished the following month in July 2001. A hydraulically-launched roller coaster, Xcelerator, was built in its place for the following season.The ride remained closed during the lawsuit as evidence.

Knott's already had several major attractions, including the Calico Mine Ride, a prototype Corkscrew coaster, a looping shuttle roller coaster named Montezooma's Revenge, and a water ride named Bigfoot Rapids. According to historian Eric Lynxwile, who wrote a book about Knott's Berry Farm, a wooden roller coaster was the only major attraction type that was absent from the park. The Knott family had begun planning for a wooden coaster almost five years before GhostRider was ultimately completed in 1998.

Great Bear was part of the Hershey Entertainment and Resorts Company's five-year plan, alongside an expansion to its Hershey Lodge and Convention Center at an estimated $26 million dollars, as well as renovations for the Hersheypark Arena. The park conducted surveys showing that guests wanted the park to add roller coasters.During the planning stages, Jeff Budgeon, then the park's planning, engineering, and maintenance director, said that park executives did not want to build record-breaking roller coasters because these would not equate to better thrills and would be expensive. Four manufacturers presented proposals to Hersheypark that would be designed specifically for the park's layout and terrain. Ultimately, the park chose Swiss manufacturer Bolliger & Mabillard (B&M).Hersheypark announced on August 19, 1997, its intentions to build a $13 million roller coaster (equivalent to $23,340,547 in 2022) for the 1998 operating season. Named the Great Bear, the attraction would be a steel inverted roller coaster built by B&M. At the time, the closest roller coaster similar to the Great Bear was located at Six Flags Great Adventure in Jackson Township, New Jersey. The park's general manager said the project would constitute ""the largest sum of money ever spent on a single attraction at Hersheypark"". Ground breaking and construction of the Great Bear started in mid-November. By December, excavation work was completed, with concrete foundation work taking place for the track and station. In the same month, track work began to be assembled on site.In the new year, the park would increase admission prices because of the construction of Great Bear. A press conference was held on March 31, for media to view the Great Bear which was nearing completion with all of the track work in place. To be finished were the electrical wiring for the controls and testing the roller coaster. The roller coaster was revealed to media personnel on May 22, to ride, and opened to the public a day later on May 23 during the park's 92nd operating season. It was the most expensive roller coaster ever constructed in the park, as well as the first inverted looping coaster in Pennsylvania. To promote the Great Bear, Hersheypark created a 30-second television advertisement called ""Brave Souls"". At the end of 1998, the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions gave the commercial a Brass Ring Award for ""originality, creativity, and excellence in marketing"". In its first five seasons of operation, the Great Bear attracted an average of 1.2 million riders annually.",,4,2 trains with 8 cars.

HangOver was originally scheduled to open in 1996 as a launched roller coaster, however, the technology at the time prevented this from occurring and forced the opening back by a year. On March 21, 1998, California's Great America opened a ride known simply as Invertigo. On April 17, 1999, Face/Off opened at Kings Island. It was originally themed after the 1997 Paramount Pictures/Touchstone Pictures film of the same name. On May 8, 1999, Two Face: The Flip Side opened at Six Flags America. It was themed after DC Comics' Batman rival, Harvey Dent A.K.A. Two-Face.In 2002, HangOver at Liseberg closed and was relocated to Allou Fun Park the following year. The ride, however, was never set up there and was relocated to Sommerland Syd where it operated under the name Tornado from July 2, 2005.An accident in October 2007 closed Two Face: The Flip Side at Six Flags America indefinitely. The coaster did not reopen for the 2008 season and was sold to a park in Italy. The ride reopened as Diabolik at Movieland Park for the 2015 season.
In 2008, Face/Off at Kings Island was renamed to Invertigo following the park's initiative to remove Paramount themes from the park after being sold to Cedar Fair two years prior.On January 27, 2011, California's Great America announced that Invertigo would be removed from the park and relocated to a different Cedar Fair park. Invertigo was removed and moved into storage in Allentown, Pennsylvania. During this time, the track received a new teal paint scheme, with the supports remaining in royal blue. On August 30, 2011, Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom announced that Invertigo would reopen as Stinger for the park's 2012 season. Construction of the main ride was completed in November 2011, and the station and queue closely followed. An incident on May 3, 2014, resulted in a temporary closure when the coaster experienced a rollback that injured two riders – both were transported to the hospital. During the 2017 offseason, it was announced by Dorney Park that Stinger would be removed to make way for future development. The coaster was demolished in April 2018.In 2011, Sommerland Syd's installation of Tornado closed with the ride currently being relocated to Bagatelle where it operates as Triops from June 30, 2012.On February 13, 2012, Kings Island posted a picture of Invertigo getting a new paint scheme on their Facebook page. The ride was given an aqua-colored track and royal blue supports.On December 15, 2017, Dorney Park announced on their website that Stinger would be removed. The ride was scrapped prior to the 2018 operating season. After Stinger was torn down, its train was reused on Invertigo at Kings Island.",,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Over-the-shoulder,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Throughout 1997, the Alton Towers park's 'Fantasy World' area was closed and all its former rides removed, except the Black Hole. The closure led to it being used for secretly constructing a new attraction known as ""SW4"" (a codename that stood for ""Secret Weapon 4"", after Nemesis' codename, ""SW3""). The attraction's construction site was surrounded by a patrol guard who kept it hidden, and the park initially did not reveal much information about it to the general public. A fence was inserted into the area along with the sign announcing that a ""world first ride opens [in] March 1998"". Many people did not know of the then-upcoming ride other than that its building stage involved making a hole that gradually increased in size. When new parts of track appeared on the site, some grew suspicious about the project. Details about SW4 were not revealed until March 1998, including its name Oblivion and its status as the ""worlds first vertical drop roller coaster"". Oblivion was given a secret military theme, which was previously used for the park's earlier SW1 and SW2 coaster projects.Oblivion's opening was accompanied by a large promotional campaign, including appearances on Blue Peter, news channels and Corn Flakes cereal box packets. Prior to its opening, memorabilia including its own brand of deodorant was available to purchase. The total cost to construct the ride was estimated at £12 million.The park area containing Oblivion was redesigned as 'X Sector'. The only surviving ride from the former area was the Black Hole roller coaster, which was externally redesigned to suit the new theme. Alton Towers moved and rethemed two existing rides from other areas of the park to open with X-Sector, Energizer and Enterprise. Despite advertising the ride as the ""worlds first vertical drop rollercoaster"", Oblivion's vertical drop is slightly less than 90 degrees, at 87.5 degrees. This is due to the trains lacking sprung wheel assemblies which would mean the transition from vertical to horizontal would be uncomfortable.For a brief period in April 2011, the ride was sponsored by Fanta. The Fanta company also had put the Oblivion rollercoaster into one of their adverts to show that the brand was being sponsored there. However, much of the Fanta branding was removed after only a few months ""following numerous complaints about the obtrusive nature of the brand"".On 8 May 2012, a reportedly suicidal 20-year-old man climbed over tall safety fencing and managed to access the underground ride area. He reportedly entered via the tunnel exit portal and walked underground, emerging on a ledge around the entrance portal. Neither he nor any guests on the ride were harmed. He was arrested for a public order offence and the ride returned to normal operation the following day.",,0,7 trains with a single car.

During his announcement, Langford had the backing of around a dozen cities, making Vision Land the first supported project with inter-municipal cooperation. The park would incorporate several attractions within its opening year, including roller coasters. The Alabama Legislature approved of the park's construction in March 1996, with ground breaking for the park taking place in April. Plans for the roller coaster's construction were being arranged near the end of November, having an estimated cost of $5 million. The roller coaster was originally to be themed to the area's historical mining operations with the attraction based on a mine cart set loose and include a 100-foot (30-meter) drop.A bond deal for the park's construction was finalized in March 1997. Langford revealed the roller coaster would be built from wood to capture the ""'old-time clickety clack flavor of a Coney Island roller coaster'"" and serve as the park's focal point attraction. Custom Coasters International (CCI) officials were present on the construction site in June to mark trees for preservation or demolition. CCI owner, Denise Larrick, disclosed the roller coaster would feature a length of 3,500 feet (1,100 meters), a maximum speed of 56 mph (90 km/h), in addition to several drops and turns. By September, concrete footings were being poured with some already in place, and the supporting structure for the station was in construction. Finalized engineering plans for the roller coaster were projected to be complete in October, in addition to vertical construction of the wooden supports to be completed during November. The roller coaster would celebrate its topping out ceremony on December 2 and construction was reported by the Birmingham Post-Herald to be ""more than half done"" during the first week of December.Vision Land representatives held a ""Name That Coaster contest"" to choose a title for its roller coaster, the name ""Rampage"" selected as the winner on December 15, 1997, out of 1,400 entries. The Rampage moniker was submitted by a local Pleasant Grove High School student, with ""Scorpion's Tail"" and ""Jaguar"" coming in second and third place, respectively. Rampage's construction was completed on March 22, 1998, with initial testing rehearsals conducted on March 24, using bagged oats acting as test dummies. The last checks on the roller coaster's track were conducted in early April. A preview was held on May 16, and opened coinciding with the opening of Vision Land on May 23.

The previous holder of all these records was Chang at Kentucky Kingdom, which was installed exactly one year prior.The Riddler's Revenge soft opened on April 1, 1998. Three days later on April 4, 1998, the ride officially opened. The opening of the ride was part of a redevelopment of the Monterey Landing themed area, which became a 4.9-acre (2.0 ha) themed area known as Movie District. As part of the expansion the park added new restaurants, retail outlets, and rethemed some existing rides.In March 2000, The Riddler's Revenge conceded the title of the world's largest vertical loop to Superman: Krypton Coaster at Six Flags Fiesta Texas. The floorless roller coaster featured a 145-foot-tall (44 m) vertical loop, 21 feet (6.4 m) taller than that of The Riddler's Revenge. The park closed several rides including The Riddler's Revenge in early 2017 to begin the construction of Metropolis, a new themed area that resulted in new paint schemes along with modified entrances and exit queues for some attractions. The new area opened on July 12, 2017, which marked the reopening of The Riddler's Revenge.",,6,3 trains with 8 cars.

It was constructed over what was previously marshland along the shores of Geauga Lake. A small, man-made island was constructed, and to keep it dry, a pump was installed near the ride's entrance. Much of the track and its supports were built over water. The track was originally red and the supports were originally green.
Serial Thriller was kept in operation following the park's ownership changes over the years involving Six Flags and Cedar Fair. After Cedar Fair purchased the park in 2004, the ride's name was changed to Thunderhawk. The following year, the track was repainted orange while the supports were repainted yellow.On September 21, 2007, Cedar Fair announced that the amusement park side of Geauga Lake would close, leaving only the water park, Wildwater Kingdom, in operation. On October 2, 2007, it was announced that Thunderhawk would be relocated to Michigan's Adventure under the same name.The ride's structure began to be reconstructed in January 2008. During construction of Thunderhawk, the roller coaster was repainted with red track and the supports remained yellow. Its padding and restraints on the trains were replaced as well in accordance with the new color scheme, as well as to improve the ride experience. Michigan's Adventure also made full-length ride DVDs available for purchase by riders. Thunderhawk opened at its current location on May 17, 2008.For the 2021 season the supports were repainted dark brown, while the track remained red.","September 16, 2007",5,2 trains with 10 cars.

It was located in the Safari Village section of the park and featured three rides inside – a dark ride named Land of the Dooz, a flume ride named Voyage to Atlantis, and a Rotor flat ride from Chance Rides named Time Shaft. Voyage to Atlantis was renamed Haunted River for the 1980 season. In 1984, Land of the Dooz was refurbished and rethemed to The Smurfs franchise, becoming known as Smurf Mountain. As popularity declined over the years, Smurf Mountain eventually closed permanently in 1993. The other two attractions were closed after the 1994 season, and the mountain's entrance was sealed off, casting uncertainty on the enclosed area's future.Kings Dominion was acquired by Paramount Parks in 1993, and under new ownership, plans were made to renovate the mountain. They considered adding a new attraction based on the upcoming 1995 Paramount film Congo. Unfortunately, the theme was later abandoned due to the film's poor box office performance. In 1996, the park moved in another direction hiring Intamin to design a new roller coaster. The ride manufacturer set out to develop a launch coaster, the company's first, that would be powered by a linear induction motor (LIM). Another ride manufacturer, Premier Rides, had pioneered the concept two years earlier with the design of Flight of Fear at Kings Island. A second concept for the theme was then proposed by Shane's Amusement Attic. The story focused on calling guests Lava Chasers, who were on a quest to explore the remnants of an ancient city inside a volcano. Although the early ride design from this concept was not used, much of the proposed theme was retained. Intamin came up with two launched models: an Impulse Coaster (shuttle) and a Suspended Catapult Coaster (complete-circuit). An early track design proposed by Intamin, much of which was later modified, featured a maximum speed of 75 mph (121 km/h), a 140-foot (43 m) Immelmann inversion with a 130-foot (40 m) drop, a horseshoe, two double heartline rolls, and a helix.On July 22, 1997, Kings Dominion unveiled the name of the new ride, Volcano: The Blast Coaster, along with several ride specifications in a press release announcement. At a cost of $20 million, the new ride would become the first launched roller coaster in the world to be inverted. Upon completion, Volcano would also become the park's tenth roller coaster and Kings Dominion began marketing its collection of coasters as the largest on the East Coast. Intamin based the prototype design on their Suspended Catapult Coaster model. In order to begin construction, several holes had to be sliced into the mountain to begin the process of gutting the interior. The two attractions remaining inside – Haunted River and Time Shaft – were completely removed along with the remains of Smurf Mountain that had been idle for several years. Some of the biggest challenges included the installation of the coaster's climax, a 155-foot-tall (47 m) roll out inversion where the track exits the structure, and the mountain's peak itself, which had to be modified into a wide opening that resembled a volcano.The new coaster was plagued with a variety of technical issues long before it opened. At the time, LIM technology was still fairly new to the industry and Intamin's system was initially buggy. Kings Dominion understood the challenge, having faced similar obstacles with the nearby Flight of Fear. Originally, Volcano only featured one LIM launch at the beginning of the ride. The trains failed to exit the volcano consistently during early testing, often rolling back down to the launch area in what is typically referred to as a rollback. Although Volcano's design accounted for rollbacks and allowed them to occur safely, the frequency of the problem led to multiple delays of the ride's grand opening. After several months of postponing, a soft opening was eventually held on August 1, 1998. Volcano: The Blast Coaster officially opened to the public two days later on August 3, 1998. During its first year of operation, the park opted to run the trains at half capacity as a temporary solution, reducing the weight and the number of rollbacks. For the 1999 season, a second set of LIMs were added further along the launch track. This supplied the added boost needed to crest the 155-foot (47 m) roll out inversion on a consistent basis.In addition to being the first of its kind to use an LIM launch system, Volcano opened as the fastest inverted roller coaster in the world, reaching a maximum speed of 70 mph (110 km/h). The previous record holder, Alpengeist at the nearby Busch Gardens Williamsburg, featured a top speed of 67 mph (108 km/h) and opened a year earlier in 1997. Volcano featured a roll out at 155 feet (47 m), making it the tallest inversion on any roller coaster.",2018,4,3 trains with 4 cars.

Described as ""a subterranean roller coaster adventure"", the tracks are fast, rough, include a few sudden falls, and end with a fast finale that includes flashing lights, and the car seemingly spinning out of control.  The coaster itself would be created by French manufacturer Reverchon while the ride's storyline and theming were developed by R&R Creative Amusement Designs and the ride's four exterminator animatronics were designed by Sally Corporation. The Exterminator is also notable for being the first ride in Kennywood history to be built outside of the park's original boundaries. 
The ride soft-opened on April 16, 1999 to media personnel and members of roller coaster enthusiast organizations such as the American Coaster Enthusiasts (ACE) before officially opening to the public on April 18. When the attraction first opened, the exterior of the showbuilding was bare concrete until receiving a more detailed brick exterior with fake windows as well as a larger, three-dimensional entrance sign in 2000.
The ride is rather popular among park guests and is usually has one of the park's longest lines, being usually over an hour wait.
Since the ride's opening, some of its theming has deteriorated over time. The news broadcast pre-show that played in the queue line was deactivated some time in the late-2000's. Also, there was previously a pest control van parked outside of the ride's entrance. The van would play pre-recorded dispatches from a panicked team of exterminators over its radio. For unknown reasons, the van was moved to the park's storage lot where it was parked for many years but, as of 2023, it is no longer there. The four exterminator animatronics no longer move as much as they used to, though the audio lines from the animatronics are still operational.
When the park introduced their Speedy Pass virtual queue system in 2022, some of the props in the queue room were removed to make room for a separate line for guests using Speedy Pass. The same year the park began requiring that a maximum of two adults (one on each side of the car) can ride together, whereas previously it had always allowed up to four.",,0,9 trains with a single car.

In its place, the park planned on building Holidog's FunTown, a children's play area featuring a three-story play structure. As part of Holidog's FunTown, Holiday World made plans to purchase a small roller coaster that all members of the family, including children, could enjoy. The park called the new roller coaster The Howler, deriving the name from the sound the area's mascot, a dog named Holidog, makes.The Howler opened on May 8, 1999. When the roller coaster opened, it operated with a single 12-passenger train custom made by Zamperla so that the lead car resembled Holidog's head while the back car resembled Holidog's hind feet and tail.",,0,Single train with 6 cars.

By the end of 1993, it was decided that one area of the future Islands of Adventure theme park would be themed after Marvel Comics, with a Hulk theme being selected for a thrill ride. The designers of the ride wanted to simulate being fired out of a cannon and subsequently set about prototyping a launch system. Universal Creative and MTS Systems Corporation had a working prototype in January 1995. Methods to achieve this acceleration were investigated into mid-1996. On-site construction of Islands of Adventure was underway in 1997, with Superior Rigging & Erection being responsible for erecting the supports and track of the roller coaster. On May 28, 1999, Islands of Adventure officially opened to the public, with The Incredible Hulk being one of its debut attractions.On August 14, 2015, Universal announced that the coaster would undergo major enhancement and refurbishment work. The ride closed on September 8, 2015, and re-opened to the public on August 4, 2016, after several days of technical rehearsals. The refurbishment involved heavy modifications to the line queue and entrance, along with a storyline theme. To improve the smoothness of the ride, sections of track were also replaced along with the trains, which were enhanced with on-board audio and special lighting effects. The launch tunnel's exterior was repainted black and the old track and trains were recycled for scrap.Concept art released in 2015 for the upcoming Universal Studios Beijing showed that the park would include a clone of the Incredible Hulk Coaster. However, Universal later clarified in 2019 that the depicted roller coaster clone would instead be themed to the Transformers franchise.",,7,8 cars.

HangOver was originally scheduled to open in 1996 as a launched roller coaster, however, the technology at the time prevented this from occurring and forced the opening back by a year. On March 21, 1998, California's Great America opened a ride known simply as Invertigo. On April 17, 1999, Face/Off opened at Kings Island. It was originally themed after the 1997 Paramount Pictures/Touchstone Pictures film of the same name. On May 8, 1999, Two Face: The Flip Side opened at Six Flags America. It was themed after DC Comics' Batman rival, Harvey Dent A.K.A. Two-Face.In 2002, HangOver at Liseberg closed and was relocated to Allou Fun Park the following year. The ride, however, was never set up there and was relocated to Sommerland Syd where it operated under the name Tornado from July 2, 2005.An accident in October 2007 closed Two Face: The Flip Side at Six Flags America indefinitely. The coaster did not reopen for the 2008 season and was sold to a park in Italy. The ride reopened as Diabolik at Movieland Park for the 2015 season.
In 2008, Face/Off at Kings Island was renamed to Invertigo following the park's initiative to remove Paramount themes from the park after being sold to Cedar Fair two years prior.On January 27, 2011, California's Great America announced that Invertigo would be removed from the park and relocated to a different Cedar Fair park. Invertigo was removed and moved into storage in Allentown, Pennsylvania. During this time, the track received a new teal paint scheme, with the supports remaining in royal blue. On August 30, 2011, Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom announced that Invertigo would reopen as Stinger for the park's 2012 season. Construction of the main ride was completed in November 2011, and the station and queue closely followed. An incident on May 3, 2014, resulted in a temporary closure when the coaster experienced a rollback that injured two riders – both were transported to the hospital. During the 2017 offseason, it was announced by Dorney Park that Stinger would be removed to make way for future development. The coaster was demolished in April 2018.In 2011, Sommerland Syd's installation of Tornado closed with the ride currently being relocated to Bagatelle where it operates as Triops from June 30, 2012.On February 13, 2012, Kings Island posted a picture of Invertigo getting a new paint scheme on their Facebook page. The ride was given an aqua-colored track and royal blue supports.On December 15, 2017, Dorney Park announced on their website that Stinger would be removed. The ride was scrapped prior to the 2018 operating season. After Stinger was torn down, its train was reused on Invertigo at Kings Island.",,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Over-the-shoulder,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seeking to preserve another classic ride, the park looked into acquiring the defunct ""Mister Twister"", which had been abandoned when the entire Elitch Gardens amusement park was relocated in Denver, Colorado. However, Mister Twister had been closed for so long that it was no longer in operating condition, and space constraints made physically relocating the ride impossible. Knoebels purchased the blueprints and set out to rebuild the roller coaster from scratch, modifying the design to fit the space available. A groundbreaking ceremony for the new Twister took place on November 3, 1998. At the time, the roller coaster was expected to cost $2 million to $3 million. Knoebels president Dick Knoebels described the ride as the largest project in the park's history.
The ride was designed by Knoebels staff designer John Fetterman based on John Allen's original design for Mister Twister. Fetterman had never ridden Mister Twister himself, but one of his friends had recommended the ride after having gone on Mister Twister. Twister ultimately cost $3 million. The Adams Construction Company built the ride over a period of eight months. The roller coaster opened on July 24, 1999. An auction for seats on Twister's inaugural ride raised $8,625 for the Make-A-Wish Foundation.",,0,2 trains with 6 cars.

HangOver was originally scheduled to open in 1996 as a launched roller coaster, however, the technology at the time prevented this from occurring and forced the opening back by a year. On March 21, 1998, California's Great America opened a ride known simply as Invertigo. On April 17, 1999, Face/Off opened at Kings Island. It was originally themed after the 1997 Paramount Pictures/Touchstone Pictures film of the same name. On May 8, 1999, Two Face: The Flip Side opened at Six Flags America. It was themed after DC Comics' Batman rival, Harvey Dent A.K.A. Two-Face.In 2002, HangOver at Liseberg closed and was relocated to Allou Fun Park the following year. The ride, however, was never set up there and was relocated to Sommerland Syd where it operated under the name Tornado from July 2, 2005.An accident in October 2007 closed Two Face: The Flip Side at Six Flags America indefinitely. The coaster did not reopen for the 2008 season and was sold to a park in Italy. The ride reopened as Diabolik at Movieland Park for the 2015 season.
In 2008, Face/Off at Kings Island was renamed to Invertigo following the park's initiative to remove Paramount themes from the park after being sold to Cedar Fair two years prior.On January 27, 2011, California's Great America announced that Invertigo would be removed from the park and relocated to a different Cedar Fair park. Invertigo was removed and moved into storage in Allentown, Pennsylvania. During this time, the track received a new teal paint scheme, with the supports remaining in royal blue. On August 30, 2011, Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom announced that Invertigo would reopen as Stinger for the park's 2012 season. Construction of the main ride was completed in November 2011, and the station and queue closely followed. An incident on May 3, 2014, resulted in a temporary closure when the coaster experienced a rollback that injured two riders – both were transported to the hospital. During the 2017 offseason, it was announced by Dorney Park that Stinger would be removed to make way for future development. The coaster was demolished in April 2018.In 2011, Sommerland Syd's installation of Tornado closed with the ride currently being relocated to Bagatelle where it operates as Triops from June 30, 2012.On February 13, 2012, Kings Island posted a picture of Invertigo getting a new paint scheme on their Facebook page. The ride was given an aqua-colored track and royal blue supports.On December 15, 2017, Dorney Park announced on their website that Stinger would be removed. The ride was scrapped prior to the 2018 operating season. After Stinger was torn down, its train was reused on Invertigo at Kings Island.",,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Over-the-shoulder,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Built by Custom Coasters International, it would be located towards the back of the park in the Britannia section. The park presented the city of Eureka with the new coaster blueprints.On February 3, 2000, the park revealed more details about their upcoming attraction. The new ride would be named The Boss and be a large terrain wooden roller coaster, very similar to The Beast at Kings Island. It would cover 12 acres (4.9 ha) of land on the northwest edge of the property, crossing over itself six times and ending with a 560-degree helix.The Boss was originally set to open on April 21, 2000, but the coaster's opening was delayed to April 29. It has been acclaimed for its ""terrain twister"" style, dipping up and down with the terrain beneath it.
In 2009, the coaster got spare Gerstlauer trains from Twisted Twins at Kentucky Kingdom after  the coasters wing of the park was closed. It had previously received other spare trains from Mega Zeph at Six Flags New Orleans.
During the ride's winter rehab prior to the start of the 2018 season, the 570° helix was removed and replaced with a 180 degree banked turn, shortening the coaster by 420 feet (130 m).

The ride cost $6 million and was built into the side of a mountain at Lake Compounce. In the four years prior to the ride's opening, Lake Compounce's owners had spent $40 million on improving the park. The opening of Boulder Dash helped increase attendance at Lake Compounce, which had suffered from declining attendance in prior years.During the 2007 off-season, about 80 percent of the ride was retracked, and some of the supports replaced, as part of a $3 million renovation. In addition, the end of the ride (which had an intentionally uneven track) was rebuilt. Lake Compounce bought PTC trains from Hersheypark's Wildcat for the 2008 season. For the 2017 season, Boulder Dash received a retracking by Martin and Vleminckx to help smooth out rough patches and replace rotting wood. The retracking also removed the triple-up hill located near the end of the ride, replacing it with a double-up hill.

A groundbreaking ceremony for the ride occurred in July 1999. The next month, Hershey Entertainment and Resorts Company announced that Hersheypark would be adding its eighth coaster, Lightning Racer. It would be the park's second roller coaster built by GCI, after the now-defunct Wildcat. After construction had started, GCI's engineers encountered some obstacles that had not been shown on the official topographic maps that Hersheypark had given them, including a fence and a Turkey Hill shop.Lightning Racer opened to the general public on May 13, 2000, three days after a media event for the coaster was hosted. When the ride opened, Hersheypark had the most roller coasters of any amusement park in Pennsylvania.

The immediate popularity of the ride, led to Six Flags Fiesta Texas to announce plans to install a Floorless Coaster in 2000; Superman: Krypton Coaster was announced on November 1, 1999. The announcement of the $20 million roller coaster was a part of a wider multimillion-dollar expansion of Six Flags Fiesta Texas.At the time of the ride's announcement, construction had already begun on unused land bordered by quarry walls and an irrigation pond. The initial plans for the ride specified it would have seven inversions including a 114-foot-tall (35 m) vertical loop and a 96-foot-tall (29 m) dive loop. Following the ride's announcement, the design was altered to remove the dive loop and increase the size of the vertical loop to 145 feet (44 m). This saw Superman: Krypton Coaster obtain the record for the world's tallest vertical loop when it officially opened to the public on March 11, 2000. It held the title for 13 years until the addition of Full Throttle at Six Flags Magic Mountain in 2013.On March 6, 2010, Six Flags Fiesta Texas offered exclusive ride time on Superman: Krypton Coaster to help celebrate the ride's 10th anniversary. On June 22, 2013, Superman: Krypton Coaster lost the title of having the world's tallest vertical loop when Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia, California  opened Full Throttle, which features a 160-foot-tall (49 m) vertical loop, 15 feet (4.6 m) taller than the loop on Superman: Krypton Coaster.On March 3, 2016, Six Flags announced that the roller coaster would be one of several rides at various Six Flags parks to feature a VR system.

Among them would be a state-of-the-art launched roller coaster named California Screamin', which uses linear induction motor (LIM) launch technology to propel its riders to a maximum speed of 55 mph (89 km/h). Although made of steel, the ride would be designed to resemble a classic wooden coaster, and it would include a vertical loop in the signature shape of Mickey Mouse's head.California Screamin' debuted with the park's grand opening on February 8, 2001. Designed by Werner Stengel and built by Intamin, it features a track length of 6,072 feet (1,851 m), making it the sixth-longest steel coaster in the world and third-longest in the US behind Fury 325 at Carowinds and Millennium Force at Cedar Point. Materials used to build the attraction included 11,500,000 pounds (5,200,000 kg) of concrete for the footers, 36 miles (58 km) of electric cables, 167 miles (269 km) of conductors, and 5,800,000 pounds (2,600,000 kg) of steel. It also became the longest roller coaster in the world to feature an inversion after the vertical loop on Son of Beast at Kings Island was removed in 2006.In addition to the LIM launch that propels the train up the first hill, an additional LIM Boost is used on the main lift midway through the ride. These motors are used in lieu of a traditional lift hill chain. The coaster is one of Disney Parks' fastest attractions, accelerating guests from zero to 55 mph (89 km/h) in four seconds. Since the resort was located next to a residential area, Disney had installed tunnels throughout the ride to block the screams from riders and reduce noise complaints from nearby residents of Anaheim and neighboring Garden Grove.Like several other coasters in Disney Parks, California Screamin' featured an onboard audio soundtrack during the ride, created by Gary Hoey and George Wilkins. On January 3, 2007, as part of the ""Rockin' Both Parks"" campaign, the audio track was temporarily replaced by a remixed version of ""Around the World"" by Red Hot Chili Peppers, and the attraction was renamed Rockin' California Screamin'. This was promoted along with Rockin' Space Mountain, a similar change made to Space Mountain in Disneyland, though that ride's audio was changed to the Red Hot Chili Peppers' cover version of ""Higher Ground"". The standard audio track was restored when the campaign ended.After the refurbishment of Disney California Adventure, from 2008 to 2009 the Mickey Mouse head located behind the vertical loop was changed to a sunburst icon with the Paradise Pier logo.
On July 15, 2017, Disney announced a complete renovation of Paradise Pier, renaming it Pixar Pier. Meanwhile, rumors began to circulate that California Screamin' would be rethemed to Pixar Animation Studios' The Incredibles. On November 2, it was confirmed that the ride would be remodeled. California Screamin' closed on January 8, 2018, for the transformation into Incredicoaster. The remodel would include a new queue line, engineering reboots of the existing launch system, new storyline, enclosed scream tunnels and a new soundtrack. The new trains were unveiled in April.

Sudden errors and malfunctions during testing delayed these. The first to open was Déjà Vu at Six Flags Magic Mountain on August 25, 2001. Déjà Vu at Six Flags Magic Mountain has since been removed and relocated to Six Flags New England as Goliath. This was followed by the opening of a further two Giant Inverted Boomerangs named Déjà Vu on September 1, 2001, at Six Flags Over Georgia and on October 7, 2001, at Six Flags Great America. The opening of the fourth Giant Inverted Boomerang was delayed even more after the problems were discovered with the first three. Stunt Fall opened on August 8, 2002, at Parque Warner Madrid (then known as Warner Bros. Movie World Madrid).In 2007, Six Flags announced the removal of Déjà Vu from both Six Flags Over Georgia and Six Flags Great America. They announced that the Six Flags Over Georgia ride would be replaced with a new themed area called Thomas Town (since rethemed to Whistlestop Park). After the Six Flags Great America ride gave its last rides on October 28, 2007, it was removed and replaced with the Buccaneer Battle ride.In January 2008, Silverwood Theme Park in Idaho announced on its website that it would install the Déjà Vu from Six Flags Great America with a projected opening date of July that year. They later announced Déjà Vu would operate as Aftershock. Before opening at its new location, the ride was overhauled by Vekoma in order to make the ride more reliable. The ride officially opened July 21, 2008. Rocky Mountain Construction, an Idaho-based manufacturing firm, assisted with the construction of the ride.In November 2009 it was announced that Mirabilandia in Brazil had purchased Six Flags Over Georgia's Déjà Vu. The ride was renamed Sky Mountain and is yet to open, but remains in storage at the park.
On August 16, 2011, Masslive reported that Six Flags New England was planning on building a Giant Inverted Boomerang for the park's 2012 season where the Shipwreck Falls attraction was located. On August 18, 2011, the ride was approved by the Agawam Planning Board, with the Los Angeles Times confirming one day later that Déjà Vu from Six Flags Magic Mountain would be relocated to Six Flags New England and would begin operation under a new name in 2012. An official announcement from Six Flags representatives was made on September 1, 2011, confirming previous reports and announcing that the relocated ride's name would be Goliath. On October 16, 2011, Déjà Vu operated for the final time. At around the same time, Shipwreck Falls was removed from Six Flags New England to make way for Goliath. Goliath at Six Flags New England was topped off on February 29, 2012. Goliath opened to the public on May 25, 2012.
In 2011, the first new Giant Inverted Boomerang since 2002 was constructed. Jinjiang Action Park opened the aptly named Giant Inverted Boomerang in September 2011. In 2014, Sochi Park Adventureland opened Quantum Leap, another Giant Inverted Boomerang.Goliath was SBNO for a majority of the 2021 season until it began demolition later that year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Over-the-shoulder,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both sides of the track were vertical, the front tower twisted and the rear tower straight with a reverse LIM segment at the top (designed to hold the train momentarily). In 2002, the ride was temporarily closed while the track was modified from 186 feet (57 m) to the city ordinance limit of 150 feet (46 m). To lower the height, the front tower was tilted to a 45-degree angle and the reverse tower lowered to 150 feet (46 m).For the 2007 season, V2 was repainted red with maroon supports. Before the repainting, it had a yellow track with blue supports, which made this ride's paint scheme very similar to the defunct coaster Wicked Twister at Cedar Point, which had also had a yellow track and supports that were a lighter shade of teal.
Vertical Velocity closed for extensive refurbishment in early 2016, which included the removal and complete disassembly of the train. Sections of track and queue railings were also removed as part of this refurbishment.
On April 3, 2019, the park sent a newsletter announcing renovations to rebrand the coaster into The Flash: Vertical Velocity, which would open next to the park's new 4-D coaster, Batman: The Ride. The opening of the two coasters rebranded that area of the park to a DC Comics-themed land, standing along with Superman: Ultimate Flight, and The Joker. Vertical Velocity's supports were painted yellow for the new theme.Following the reopening of the park after its prolonged closure from the COVID-19 pandemic, The Flash once again was dormant, with barricades blocking the hill leading to the line in favor of a Mask Relief Area, where parkgoers could take off their personal masks if they so chose. The Flash's train was once again removed, this time going completely missing, whereas during the prior refurbishment to turn the coaster into The Flash, the train was disassembled and subsequently reassembled in the station.",,1,Single train with 7 cars.

The ride officially opened July 21, 2008. Rocky Mountain Construction, an Idaho-based manufacturing firm, assisted with the construction of the ride.In November 2009 it was announced that Mirabilandia in Brazil had purchased Six Flags Over Georgia's Déjà Vu. The ride was renamed Sky Mountain and is yet to open, but remains in storage at the park.
On August 16, 2011, Masslive reported that Six Flags New England was planning on building a Giant Inverted Boomerang for the park's 2012 season where the Shipwreck Falls attraction was located. On August 18, 2011, the ride was approved by the Agawam Planning Board, with the Los Angeles Times confirming one day later that Déjà Vu from Six Flags Magic Mountain would be relocated to Six Flags New England and would begin operation under a new name in 2012. An official announcement from Six Flags representatives was made on September 1, 2011, confirming previous reports and announcing that the relocated ride's name would be Goliath. On October 16, 2011, Déjà Vu operated for the final time. At around the same time, Shipwreck Falls was removed from Six Flags New England to make way for Goliath. Goliath at Six Flags New England was topped off on February 29, 2012. Goliath opened to the public on May 25, 2012.
In 2011, the first new Giant Inverted Boomerang since 2002 was constructed. Jinjiang Action Park opened the aptly named Giant Inverted Boomerang in September 2011. In 2014, Sochi Park Adventureland opened Quantum Leap, another Giant Inverted Boomerang.Goliath was SBNO for a majority of the 2021 season until it began demolition later that year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Over-the-shoulder,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ride vehicles were themed to the many cars one can find on the Southern California freeway systems, (such as Highway Patrol cars or Classic Surfer ""Woodies"").

It was called the Thrust Air 2000 and featured a unique one-of-a-kind launch system known as a compressed air launch. The prototype featured an oval layout with a 170-foot (52 m) top hat. The trains featured over-the-shoulder restraints and rubber tires instead of polyurethane wheels. The polyurethane wheels would cause a lot of noise during the launch. Originally, the coaster was supposed to be built at California's Great America, but those plans were scrapped.On August 1, 2000, it was announced that Hypersonic XLC would be coming to Kings Dominion for the 2001 season. It would be one of the park's three launched roller coasters, with the others being Flight of Fear and Volcano: The Blast Coaster. To save on costs, the park decided to buy the Thrust Air 2000 prototype from the S&S Worldwide testing facility. The ride would have some differences from when it was originally built. These changes included lap bar restraints and a longer layout. Over 60 trucks carried the track and other components on a 2,200-mile (3,500 km) journey across the United States. Construction of Hypersonic XLC began in October 2000 when track pieces arrived at Kings Dominion.Hypersonic XLC officially opened to the general public on time on March 24, the first day of the 2001 season.The attraction suffered from constant downtime, since it was a prototype. Hypersonic XLC was closed for three months during the 2002 season to undergo modifications. On June 20, 2002, the ride reopened with a few minor changes.During the 2006-2007 off-season, Kings Dominion put Hypersonic XLC up for sale. The attraction would operate for the final time in 2007. In January 2008, the park removed Hypersonic from its web site. On the park's opening day on March 22, 2008, Hypersonic XLC had been disassembled and was placed in its current laydown yard, along part of the park's back road. 
In 2009, El Dorado took the spot of where Hypersonic XLC once stood. After its removal two years later, WindSeeker opened in its place in 2012. The platform is all that remains at the ride's former location between Grizzly and Twisted Timbers.","October 28, 2007",0,,,El Dorado (2009-2011) WindSeeker,,"$15,000,000 USD",54 in (137 cm),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0-80 in 1.8 seconds,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among them would be a state-of-the-art launched roller coaster named California Screamin', which uses linear induction motor (LIM) launch technology to propel its riders to a maximum speed of 55 mph (89 km/h). Although made of steel, the ride would be designed to resemble a classic wooden coaster, and it would include a vertical loop in the signature shape of Mickey Mouse's head.California Screamin' debuted with the park's grand opening on February 8, 2001. Designed by Werner Stengel and built by Intamin, it features a track length of 6,072 feet (1,851 m), making it the sixth-longest steel coaster in the world and third-longest in the US behind Fury 325 at Carowinds and Millennium Force at Cedar Point. Materials used to build the attraction included 11,500,000 pounds (5,200,000 kg) of concrete for the footers, 36 miles (58 km) of electric cables, 167 miles (269 km) of conductors, and 5,800,000 pounds (2,600,000 kg) of steel. It also became the longest roller coaster in the world to feature an inversion after the vertical loop on Son of Beast at Kings Island was removed in 2006.In addition to the LIM launch that propels the train up the first hill, an additional LIM Boost is used on the main lift midway through the ride. These motors are used in lieu of a traditional lift hill chain. The coaster is one of Disney Parks' fastest attractions, accelerating guests from zero to 55 mph (89 km/h) in four seconds. Since the resort was located next to a residential area, Disney had installed tunnels throughout the ride to block the screams from riders and reduce noise complaints from nearby residents of Anaheim and neighboring Garden Grove.Like several other coasters in Disney Parks, California Screamin' featured an onboard audio soundtrack during the ride, created by Gary Hoey and George Wilkins. On January 3, 2007, as part of the ""Rockin' Both Parks"" campaign, the audio track was temporarily replaced by a remixed version of ""Around the World"" by Red Hot Chili Peppers, and the attraction was renamed Rockin' California Screamin'. This was promoted along with Rockin' Space Mountain, a similar change made to Space Mountain in Disneyland, though that ride's audio was changed to the Red Hot Chili Peppers' cover version of ""Higher Ground"". The standard audio track was restored when the campaign ended.After the refurbishment of Disney California Adventure, from 2008 to 2009 the Mickey Mouse head located behind the vertical loop was changed to a sunburst icon with the Paradise Pier logo.
On July 15, 2017, Disney announced a complete renovation of Paradise Pier, renaming it Pixar Pier. Meanwhile, rumors began to circulate that California Screamin' would be rethemed to Pixar Animation Studios' The Incredibles. On November 2, it was confirmed that the ride would be remodeled. California Screamin' closed on January 8, 2018, for the transformation into Incredicoaster. The remodel would include a new queue line, engineering reboots of the existing launch system, new storyline, enclosed scream tunnels and a new soundtrack. The new trains were unveiled in April.

In August 2000, the park publicly revealed their plans in celebration of the park's 40th anniversary. Although specifications were withheld, they confirmed Giovanola as the manufacturer and that the new coaster would be similar to Goliath at Six Flags Magic Mountain and constructed in the Texas section of the park. As survey markers began to appear in September, it became clear that the new coaster would extend from the Texas section to the employee cantina, pool and softball fields then out into the parking lot. By the time the official announcement, employee areas had been demolished, and teal-colored supports were beginning to arrive stacked in the parking lot. Construction was completed in March 2001 and testing began the following month. A media preview was held on April 26, 2001, and Titan opened to the public the following day.Titan became one of the top ten fastest roller coasters in the United States, with its speed matched by Phantom's Revenge at Kennywood and Goliath at Six Flags Magic Mountain.

Because Batman: The Dark Knight's name was so similar to the new roller coaster, it was temporarily renamed Batman: The Ride to avoid confusion with the upcoming attraction. However, as construction on the new roller coaster progressed, the city of Agawam forced Six Flags to stop construction after it was discovered the park had not received the appropriate construction permits.

Its concept would utilize mine cart style train cars in a ride through the old work site where, in the backstory for the land, the very first bones were found in Diggs County. Warning signs would flank the entry as guests boarded what could be assumed was an attraction set up by the grad students that ran the nearby dig site. During the ride, guests would pass through dinosaur bones and around the centerpiece for this out-of-control wooden roller coaster: an old excavator that the college kids altered to look like a dinosaur, giving the attraction its name. The Excavator would be cancelled due to budget cuts after the failure of Disneyland Paris, formerly known as Euro Disney. Fortunately, officials revisited the idea of a mine train roller coaster for Expedition Everest, which would open in 2006.On September 29, 2000, Disney announced that they would be adding new attractions to their Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom parks. The Magic Kingdom would be getting The Magic Carpets of Aladdin, a family ride based on the 1992 film Aladdin. Disney's Animal Kingdom would be receiving Chester and Hester's Dino-Rama, which would be located in the DinoLand U.S.A. area. The new section would feature several carnival games and a snack trailer on an old asphalt parking lot across from a gas station and store. Plus, this area would include two new rides, which were Primeval Whirl and TriceraTop Spin. TriceraTop Spin would be similar to The Magic Carpets of Aladdin, while Primeval Whirl would be a dual track spinning Wild Mouse roller coaster built by Reverchon Industries.Primeval Whirl officially opened to the public on March 31, 2002. It was the first roller coaster to open at Disney's Animal Kingdom.On June 17, 2019, the ride was reduced to seasonal operation, and later in September, park officials stated that the attraction would only be operating on a seasonal basis. On July 16, 2020, officials confirmed that the attraction would not re-open after various speculation. After the announcement, the ride vehicles were removed from the track.In September 2021, construction walls were installed in the surrounding area of the attraction. Demolition of the ride began that same month on September 22 with the removal of track sections. The entrance sign was taken down a few days later. By November, both tracks were completely demolished.","July 11, 2020",0,,,Encanto (Tropical Americas),,,48 in (122 cm),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it was never built at Fiesta Texas, as the park exceeded its yearly budget. The coaster would sit in storage in the employee parking lot behind Poltergeist for the rest of the 2000 season.
In 2001, the ride was relocated to then under construction Parque Warner Madrid (then known as Warner Bros. Movie World Madrid), where it was assembled and opened as Tom & Jerry when the park opened on 6 April 2002.

This would bring the total to 15, beating the world coaster capital, Cedar Point. X was a prototype 4th Dimension roller coaster by Arrow Dynamics.The ride was planned to open in the summer of 2001, but the opening was delayed when it suffered design flaws. X opened for passholders on December 24, 2001, and officially opened on January 12, 2002. A month before opening, Arrow Dynamics filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy due to the ride's misjudged costs stemming from Six Flags asking for a much larger ride than Arrow had successfully prototyped (This is covered in the 2016 documentary The Legacy of Arrow Development). The manufacturer had lost millions of dollars on the project.X was closed indefinitely in June 2002 due to issues with the trains. It was discovered that one of the coach seats that flipped riders was not moving smoothly. The ride reopened on August 13, 2002 after modifications were made to make it reliable.On February 8, 2003, Super Bowl MVP Dexter Jackson took a ride on X as part of a victory celebration of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers football team.
On November 1, 2007, Six Flags Magic Mountain announced a redesign. X closed on December 2, 2007, to be redesigned including new trains with a pneumatic restraint system (an improvement over the original mechanically operated restraints that would frequently jam), a new color scheme of red track and black supports (originally pink track and yellow supports), and an all-new, innovative state-of-the-art visual, audio and sensory effects. In a projected $10 million investment, X reopened on May 24, 2008, as X2. Six Flags Magic Mountain hired S&S Arrow to build new trains for X2. The new trains are lighter to reduce the amount of wear and downtime. X2 also took on a new load/unload method and third train to increase the ride capacity by 50%. Testing of the trains began on March 6, 2008.The attraction was closed in 2013 due to a broken chain lift. It reopened in January 2014 with only a single train.",,2,2 trains with 7 cars.

Only three of these were ever built: Twist n' Shout, Scorpion at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay in America, and the other is said to be in a travelling funfair in Africa.
Purchased by the Bembom family, the ride debuted at OK Corral, in France, in the early 1980's, before being moved to the United Kingdom in 1987, where it then operated at the Ocean Beach Amusement park in Rhyl, North Wales.
In 1989, the ride was moved to Camelot Theme Park in Lancashire, England, and was rebranded as the Tower of Terror.
The ride was themed around a castle, which concealed the loop, and was one of the park's most popular attractions. 
Tower of Terror closed in 2000, following the end of its lease agreement with the ride's owners, and also to make way for a planned Vekoma Invertigo rollercoaster. While it was being dismantled, some sparks from a saw hit the foam castle theming, destroying it in the process. The ride suffered  some scorch marks, but was otherwise unscathed.
Following this, the rollercoaster was moved to Dreamland Margate, where it operated as Looping Star, from 2001 to 2002.
It opened in 2003 at Loudoun Castle, as a part of the new rides line-up brought in by new owner, Henk Bembom. For the 2007 season, the trains were given a ""mine train"" theme. Twist n' Shout remained one of the most popular rides in the park until its closure in 2010. 
After the 2010 season, Twist n' Shout closed with the park. It remained standing but not operating from 2010 to 2016, and was listed for sale through amusement ride reseller Ital International.In July 2017, the ride was moved to the new Fun Park Mirnovec (now Dalmaland) in Croatia, where it now operates as Big Blue.",2010,1,6 cars.

The steel roller coaster is a spinning variation that features two chain lift hills and opened to the public on 27 March 2004. It was manufactured by Maurer AG.In early 2015, large portions of the ride's track were dismantled in order to be filled with sand. This was to reduce noise for both park guests and nearby residents.

It was built on the site of the Lake Park Terrace, a pavilion moved to Lagoon from the park's original location on the shore of the Great Salt Lake. The Terrace was removed on October 12, 2004, to make room for the new roller coaster, as the structure's deterioration had passed the point of feasible maintenance. It was one of four roller coasters added to the park in a 10-year span, and the first to use a magnetic braking system. The Bat was the third 'family-friendly' ride, allowing both adults and children, to be installed in the park, following the Kontiki and Dragon Fly flat rides installed in 2004.

Shortly before the park's 1993 season, the name was expanded to ""Scooby-Doo's Ghoster Coaster"".  
In 1993, Paramount Parks bought Carowinds' parent company and added areas themed to the Nickelodeon television channel, owned by their parent company Viacom.  As part of this, the Hanna-Barbera area was eventually annexed into the Nickelodeon Central area, and in 2005, the roller coaster was renamed ""Fairly Odd Coaster"".
As part of the new theming, the wooden superstructure was painted indigo, and the cars repainted to mimic the Fairy Oddparents characters from the show; one train pink and the other green, with the fairies' faces on the front of the cars. To depict these characters as roller coaster trains is accurate to the television show because on screen, the fairies can change their shape at will, though their faces always remain visible on whatever they become.
The coaster was renamed Woodstock Express in 2010 when the area was rethemed as Planet Snoopy.  In 2015, Woodstock Express was repainted periwinkle with yellow side-rails.",,0,,,,,,40 in (102 cm),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The New England park went to a roller coaster manufacturer, Gerstlauer, to help bring a coaster to the park that all ages would be attracted to. Gerstlauer then introduced Six Flags with the manufacturer's latest development of the spinning roller coaster, which was developed in the early 2000s. In early 2005, Six Flags New England announced its plans for the upcoming season by adding two roller coasters to the park, including Mr. Six's Pandemonium, themed after the advertising character of the company. Without any notice, Six Flags New England removed the theming of Mr. Six on the roller coaster and operated it as Pandemonium for the start of the 2007 season.
In late 2006 and early 2007, both Six Flags Fiesta Texas and Six Flags St. Louis announced the addition of a new spinning coaster to their respective parks. Six Flags licensed with professional skateboarder, Tony Hawk, to help brand the company's newest two coasters after the success of the Boom Boom HuckJam, which toured many Six Flags parks in 2006. The ride was originally billed as the ""Tony Hawk experience"" and was designed to have the look and feel of a large red-and-black skatepark. It offered a full ""extreme sports"" experience, with monitors in the queue lines displaying highlights of the history of action sports and a large spinning Tony Hawk figure crowning the ride. In 2007, both parks equipped their two new coasters with CD ride technology that captures the guests' on-ride experience which is put on a DVD for a take home souvenir.With the success of Tony Hawk's Big Spin, Six Flags announced in late 2007 that they would be adding two more to their parks. Six Flags Discovery Kingdom and Six Flags Over Texas both opened the next two installments in the spring of 2008.In November 2010, Six Flags began the process of cancelling licensed intellectual property deals they had with various brands, including the agreement with Tony Hawk himself, as the company was emerging itself from bankruptcy at that time. Discovery Kingdom, Fiesta Texas, and Over Texas operated the coasters under Hawk's brand until January 2011, following the 2010 run of Holiday in the Park. Afterward, those three parks quickly dropped Hawk's name from the ride and any other memorabilia associated with him and operated their coaster as Big Spin for the remainder of the season. At the start of the new season in 2011, all four Tony Hawk's Big Spins were officially renamed to Pandemonium like their sister park at New England.
In late 2011, Six Flags announced that Superman: Ultimate Flight would be built at Discovery Kingdom, replacing their Pandemonium roller coaster. The new ride would reuse the PLC room and extended queue area, which was formerly the station for Zonga. Pandemonium at Discovery Kingdom officially closed at the park on January 1, 2012. As Pandemonium was a relatively new coaster, Six Flags moved it to the headquarters of Larson International and Roller Coaster Museum, both located in Plainview, Texas, for storage. In mid 2012, Six Flags México announced The Joker for the 2013 season. The track of the stored Pandemonium was moved from Texas to Mexico.",,,,,,,,42 in (107 cm),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Single rider line available,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Flash Pass available,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In early 2005, Six Flags New England announced its plans for the upcoming season by adding two roller coasters to the park, including Mr. Six's Pandemonium, themed after the advertising character of the company. Without any notice, Six Flags New England removed the theming of Mr. Six on the roller coaster and operated it as Pandemonium for the start of the 2007 season.
In late 2006 and early 2007, both Six Flags Fiesta Texas and Six Flags St. Louis announced the addition of a new spinning coaster to their respective parks. Six Flags licensed with professional skateboarder, Tony Hawk, to help brand the company's newest two coasters after the success of the Boom Boom HuckJam, which toured many Six Flags parks in 2006. The ride was originally billed as the ""Tony Hawk experience"" and was designed to have the look and feel of a large red-and-black skatepark. It offered a full ""extreme sports"" experience, with monitors in the queue lines displaying highlights of the history of action sports and a large spinning Tony Hawk figure crowning the ride. In 2007, both parks equipped their two new coasters with CD ride technology that captures the guests' on-ride experience which is put on a DVD for a take home souvenir.With the success of Tony Hawk's Big Spin, Six Flags announced in late 2007 that they would be adding two more to their parks. Six Flags Discovery Kingdom and Six Flags Over Texas both opened the next two installments in the spring of 2008.In November 2010, Six Flags began the process of cancelling licensed intellectual property deals they had with various brands, including the agreement with Tony Hawk himself, as the company was emerging itself from bankruptcy at that time. Discovery Kingdom, Fiesta Texas, and Over Texas operated the coasters under Hawk's brand until January 2011, following the 2010 run of Holiday in the Park. Afterward, those three parks quickly dropped Hawk's name from the ride and any other memorabilia associated with him and operated their coaster as Big Spin for the remainder of the season. At the start of the new season in 2011, all four Tony Hawk's Big Spins were officially renamed to Pandemonium like their sister park at New England.
In late 2011, Six Flags announced that Superman: Ultimate Flight would be built at Discovery Kingdom, replacing their Pandemonium roller coaster. The new ride would reuse the PLC room and extended queue area, which was formerly the station for Zonga. Pandemonium at Discovery Kingdom officially closed at the park on January 1, 2012. As Pandemonium was a relatively new coaster, Six Flags moved it to the headquarters of Larson International and Roller Coaster Museum, both located in Plainview, Texas, for storage.

Allen of the Philadelphia Toboggan Coasters (PTC). It is based on the first three roller coasters he designed shortly after becoming the company's president in 1954. These coasters opened in 1956 at Hunt's Pier, Angela Park and the Gooding Zoo (now the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium).  Allen modified the original design, making Woodstock Express a little taller and longer.  He eliminated the curved loading station as well, opting instead for an in-line station that precedes the curve to the lift hill.  This modified design was then used to build two nearly identical models at Kings Dominion and Carowinds. A third copy at Canada's Wonderland was also based on this design but is taller and slightly longer, and it was designed by Curtis D. Summers.The coaster was originally named Scooby Doo and opened with the park in 1972 as part of ""The Happy Land of Hanna-Barbera"".  Paying homage to The Beast after its successful launch in 1979, Scooby Doo was renamed The Beastie, and a tunnel was added to the bottom of its first drop in time for the 1980 season.  In 2006, a decision was made during the Nickelodeon Universe overhaul to remove the tunnel and rename it to Fairly Odd Coaster (based on the Nickelodeon TV show The Fairly OddParents). Although Cedar Fair had the rights to continue using the themes through 2016 following its purchase of the park in 2006, it was decided to remove all remaining Hanna-Barbera and Nickelodeon themes from the kids area in time for the start of the 2010 season. As a result, the ride went through another name change to Woodstock Express in line with the new Planet Snoopy makeover.Woodstock Express was awarded ACE Coaster Classic status, but that status has since been rescinded as a result of recent changes to the coaster.",,0,2 trains with 5 cars.

By the end of 2005, 40 rides had been added, including the new coaster the Wild Mouse, 500 campground spaces with modern amenities, renovated racing facilities, a water park and picnic pavilions.
The Jones family started talking about adding a wooden roller coaster to their park years before the Kentucky Rumbler was built. After they decided, Dallas Jones contacted Great Coasters International. 
Vice President of Sales & Design Jeff Pike started working for GCII after college, under the tutelage of Mike Boodley. The Kentucky Rumbler was Pike's first solo design. 
The Rye Aeroplane is a long-defunct coaster in the city of Rye, New York. It served as the inspiration for parts of the ride, including the first drop. The Rumbler's first drop is a mirror Image of the Aeroplane Coasters.
On October 28, 2005 the park officially named their new wooden roller coaster “Kentucky Rumbler”. Derek Sailors from Surfside Beach, South Carolina, was the winner of the contest to name the ride. Beech Bend received thousands of entries for the contest from all over the world.
The Kentucky Rumbler opened in 2006 to great reviews. It was ranked in the Top Five New Rides in the World by Amusement Today magazine, for 2006.",,0,Single train with 12 cars.

Fahrenheit was announced in a Hersheypark press release on September 27, 2007. Typically, the park built a major attraction every two years, but the previous large attraction, the Boardwalk at Hersheypark, had opened earlier the same year. The new coaster replaced the Western Chute-Out, which had operated since 1988 or 1991. The Western Chute-Out's ridership had declined following the opening of the Boardwalk at Hersheypark, which had contained five water attractions, and demolition of the Western Chute-Out began in early September 2007. Ahead of Fahrenheit's opening, Hersheypark launched a viral marketing campaign to promote the project.The construction of Fahrenheit caused the opening of the Boardwalk at Hersheypark to be delayed for the 2008 season. Fahrenheit opened on May 24, 2008. The ride cost an estimated $12.1 million. Fahrenheit was Hersheypark's 11th roller coaster and was one of two new attractions for the 2008 season, the other being the Howler, a spinning flat ride adjacent to Fahrenheit. To promote the new rides, Hersheypark launched a 14-week mobile tour, stopping at 30 locations across the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern United States.",,6,,,,,"US$12,100,000",54 in (137 cm),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, Paramount took over operations in time to determine the ride's theme which was based on the Paramount Pictures film Top Gun.  On November 11, 1992, Kings Island announced that a new roller coaster named Top Gun would be added to the park. The ride would be an Arrow Dynamics suspended coaster, very similar to The Bat which had operated at the park in the 1980s. Construction of Top Gun began in December 1992 and was completed in early spring 1993. The park hired John DeCuir Jr., a production designer who worked on the film, to design the ride's loading platform, so that it would resemble the deck of an aircraft carrier. Top Gun opened on April 9, 1993.
Top Gun was renamed Flight Deck in 2008, two years after Cedar Fair purchased the park. The theme music and signage were changed to remove all references to the film. Cedar Fair had rights to continue using the Top Gun movie theme through 2016 but made the decision to remove all Paramount themes from the park much sooner. On October 29, 2013, the 33rd anniversary of the announcement of the original Bat, the park announced that Flight Deck would be renamed The Bat for the 2014 season. The ride was repainted with a new color scheme of orange track with charcoal supports, and black trains.",,0,2 trains with 7 cars.

The ride would be named Ravine Flyer II, after an early 20th-century coaster at Waldameer that operated from 1922 to 1938. At the time of its announcement, Ravine Flyer II was planned to be completed in 2000. At $3.5 million, it would be the most expensive ride in Waldameer's history. The ride would cross over Pennsylvania Route 832, the main entrance to the nearby Presque Isle State Park. Waldameer had previously obtained a 120-foot-long (37 m) easement allowing the park to build a roller coaster above PA 832. By September 1998, Custom Coasters International (CCI) had been hired to design the ride, which had been pushed back to release in 2001. The ride was planned to be 3,000 feet (910 m) long, with a 65-foot-tall (20 m) lift hill and 110-foot-tall (34 m) drop.By mid-2001, the ride's construction had been delayed due to lawsuits. Brian and Antoinette Candela, who lived near the proposed coaster, claimed that the ride violated a Pennsylvania state law because it was within a ""bluff recession hazard area"". Additionally, the Pennsylvania government planned to build a greenway and visitor center near the ride. Brian Candela subsequently accused Waldameer owner Paul Nelson of bragging about his political connections, which Nelson had claimed would permit the ride's construction. Local officials granted a zoning variance to Waldameer in April 2004, allowing the park to build the ride above PA 832. By then, the ride's cost had increased to $6 million. The roller coaster's opponents relented after a court ruled in Waldameer's favor in January 2006.Meanwhile, the Gravity Group was hired to construct the ride following CCI's bankruptcy in 2002. The ride opened on May 17, 2008. Waldameer held an auction to select the first 24 riders.",,0,2 trains with 6 cars.

The new coaster was given the code name ""Rick's Delight""—which was a reference to Duinrell's mascot, Rick the Frog. The park was awarded when a permit from the municipality of Wassenaar over the objections of some residents and after a lengthy court battle. Noise and traffic studies were conducted and showed that the new coaster would not adversely influence these environmental factors in the area surrounding the park (results were just under the 45 decibel benchmark). A Duinrell spokesperson also stated that measures were being taken to further mitigate the noise from the park.

The notice also stated that the contractor was ""Maurer Rides GmbH,"" located in Munich, Germany.The new attraction was officially announced by Universal Studios on March 19, 2008. Although the layout was not revealed, the original press release stated that the roller coaster's vertical lift hill would be 167 feet (51 m) tall, and that the trains would reach a maximum speed of 65 miles per hour (105 km/h). It also mentioned that each train would be equipped with a multi-media package, LED lights, built-in video recorders, and the option for riders to choose a song from a list to be played during the course of the ride. The ride would also include six near miss encounters. At the time, the new roller coaster was scheduled to open in Spring 2009.  Also, in the months after the announcement, Universal Studios surveyed guests on what songs they think should be included in the roller coaster. Some of the artists that guests could choose from were: The Black Eyed Peas, Bee Gees, The Beach Boys, and Johnny Cash.
Construction began in May 2008 with preliminary land clearing, which caused the removal of some of Twister...Ride it Out's outdoor extended queue. The first track pieces were installed during the week of December 7, 2008. In February 2009, Universal launched a website for the attraction, which included a construction blog and photographs chronicling progress of the attraction's construction. The track layout was completed at the end of April 2009 with the crowning of the lift hill.In April 2009, Universal confirmed that the roller coaster would not open as originally planned and said it would open in the summer. Though Universal has never mentioned what the exact problem with the roller coaster was, it is believed by newspapers that issues with the anti-rollback devices on the lift hill that were not working correctly caused the delay.After the issues with the ride were resolved, Hollywood Rip Ride Rockit began public previews in mid-August 2009. On August 19, 2009, Universal Studios Florida officially opened the attraction. It continued to experience technical issues early on after opening. A number of its features worked sporadically or not at all. There were also operational issues, such as slower-than-expected loading times that diminished capacity and led to long lines. One of the notable complaints was the rough ride experience, especially for guests sitting in the back seat.Hollywood Rip Ride Rockit closed indefinitely in September 2010. Maurer issued an alert warning that stress testing of its X-Car ride vehicles had found that the coupling bars holding the trains together would not be ""fatigue endurable."" It eventually reopened on October 28, 2010, with refurbished trains to improve the ride experience.",,0,7 trains with 2 cars.

The park also announced that the attraction would include a roller coaster, but that it would be more than just a roller coaster. Joseph Couceiro—vice president of sales and marketing—described the ride as ""the next generation SeaWorld attraction"" that would immerse guests in elements of marine life.Artists' concepts of the new attraction were leaked onto the Internet in April 2008; however, SeaWorld officials would not confirm whether the images were accurate representations of the final design, but said that the roller coaster would have a gliding sensation. At that point, construction on a large site within the park had already begun. On May 29, 2008, park officials confirmed that the attraction would be named Manta, and announced additional details about the attraction.Construction of the roller coaster track and attraction buildings began in September 2008.

Thorpe Park created a dedicated website for the new ride, hyperbolically claiming it would be ""the scariest ride in the world."" The official press release detailing the park's fourth major roller coaster confirmed a development partnership with Lionsgate and Twisted Pictures, and it claimed Saw would feature ""the steepest freefall drop in the world."" The press release also revealed that ""the world's first ever horror movie-themed rollercoaster"" would be marketed under the slogan ""Face your Fears.""When SAW - The Ride opened, it was not the steepest rollercoaster in the world - Steel Hawg at Indiana Beach had opened the previous year with a steeper 111° drop. However, unlike Steel Hawg's 111° drop, SAW's 100° drop does not have any trim brakes on it; hence, as the drop was 'free' (not constrained by brakes), it was marketed specifically as having 'the world's steepest freefall drop'. This particular accolade was taken by The Monster in 2016.
During construction, the codename ""Project Dylan"" was used to keep the movie tie in secret. The name 'Dylan' in fact came from the project director's cat, with no actual relevance to the ride. A large section of the Canada Creek Railway had to be rebuilt, affecting a small section of the Samurai queue line. Competition winners and annual pass holders were allowed to attend a preview event, before it opened to the public on 14 March 2009. Saw Alive, a live-action horror maze, opened at the park in 2010 to complement the ride. It caught fire in April 2011 but was repaired over the course of a month. Not much was added for the next few years. The only additions were the addition of props from Saw Alive due to its closure at the end of the 2018 season and brand new dispatch audio in 2021.
In 2019, for the 10th anniversary of the ride's opening, the sign by the ride entrance was repainted, and the live actors were temporarily reintroduced for part of the 2019 season.

A week after its opening, Universal Studios Singapore identified a problem in a ride vehicle during routine testing. The ride closed for repair on 25 March 2010. Both rides remained closed for about 11 months thereafter.In August 2010, Resorts World Sentosa publicly addressed the reason for closure of the ride, stating that the problem lies with the design of the ride vehicles and not the track layout. Higher than anticipated stress and vibration levels caused fatigue cracks to develop in the seat-post supports of the ""Human"" coaster car. The redesigned component was to eliminate the weld entirely and was also to be installed with additional strength-reinforcement parts. Extensive ride testing cycles and inspections were conducted, as the ride needed to be re-certified before it reopened to the public. In early February 2011, Universal Studios Singapore announced the rides would re-open on 21 February 2011.On 21 December 2010, Battlestar Galactica: Human vs. Cylon entered the final testing stage with newly reinforced cars for both the ""Human"" and ""Cylon"" coasters. On 4 February 2011, the ride was opened unofficially for ""technical rehearsals"", with the ride officially reopening as planned on 21 February 2011.On 21 July 2013, the ride was closed again for review. More than a year passed before Resorts World Sentosa announced, in November 2014, that Battlestar Galactica: Human vs Cylon would reopen in early 2015 with new trains. On 25 May 2015, Universal Studios Singapore announced that the ride will return with all-new ride vehicles on 27 May 2015. The ride was officially reopened as planned two days later, with the ride vehicles being changed from four-abreast seating to two-abreast seating.

Nikolaus Job, the CEO of Belantis has stated he expected the installation of Huracan would lead to a 10 to 15 percent growth in visitor volume.The installation of Huracan has also led to other rides at Belantis being themed to match Huracan.

The new ride would be a Giga Coaster model from Swiss manufacturer Intamin exceeding 300 feet (91 m) in height. Its name would reference the late NASCAR racing legend Dale Earnhardt, who had been nicknamed the ""Intimidator"". Dale Earnhardt Incorporated CEO Jeff Steiner, Dale Earnhardt's daughter Taylor Earnhardt, and then Cedar Fair CEO Dick Kinzel were all in attendance of the press event, which was led by Kings Dominion's Director of Marketing Ed Kuhlmann. Animation videos of the ride as well as a working scale model were on display. The ride would be the 15th operating roller coaster at Kings Dominion.The new coaster was built on the former land occupied by the Safari Monorail, which closed in 1993. Kings Dominion broke ground on June 1, 2009, with the first track pieces arriving several days later. On August 19, 2009, the first pieces of steel were put into place. The 305-foot (93 m) lift hill was topped off a few months later in November. Construction continued through the winter and completed on January 9, 2010. First test runs began on March 14, 2010, and Kings Dominion announced that the ride was complete two weeks later. Intimidator 305 had cost $25 million to construct.Intimidator 305 was considered by amusement-park enthusiasts to be one of the most anticipated new roller coasters of 2010. A media preview event was held on April 1, 2010, and the ride opened the following day, when Kings Dominion opened for the season. The plaza near the ride's entrance featured Dale Earnhardt's black Monte Carlo on display, as well as commemorative plaques celebrating the famed driver's career. Intimidator 305 was one of two roller coasters themed to Earnhardt that opened in 2010; the other was Intimidator, a hypercoaster manufactured by Bolliger & Mabillard at Carowinds, another Cedar Fair park.

Shortly before the park's 1993 season, the name was expanded to ""Scooby-Doo's Ghoster Coaster"".  
In 1993, Paramount Parks bought Carowinds' parent company and added areas themed to the Nickelodeon television channel, owned by their parent company Viacom.  As part of this, the Hanna-Barbera area was eventually annexed into the Nickelodeon Central area, and in 2005, the roller coaster was renamed ""Fairly Odd Coaster"".
As part of the new theming, the wooden superstructure was painted indigo, and the cars repainted to mimic the Fairy Oddparents characters from the show; one train pink and the other green, with the fairies' faces on the front of the cars. To depict these characters as roller coaster trains is accurate to the television show because on screen, the fairies can change their shape at will, though their faces always remain visible on whatever they become.
The coaster was renamed Woodstock Express in 2010 when the area was rethemed as Planet Snoopy.

Allen of the Philadelphia Toboggan Coasters (PTC). It is based on the first three roller coasters he designed shortly after becoming the company's president in 1954. These coasters opened in 1956 at Hunt's Pier, Angela Park and the Gooding Zoo (now the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium).  Allen modified the original design, making Woodstock Express a little taller and longer.  He eliminated the curved loading station as well, opting instead for an in-line station that precedes the curve to the lift hill.  This modified design was then used to build two nearly identical models at Kings Dominion and Carowinds. A third copy at Canada's Wonderland was also based on this design but is taller and slightly longer, and it was designed by Curtis D. Summers.The coaster was originally named Scooby Doo and opened with the park in 1972 as part of ""The Happy Land of Hanna-Barbera"".  Paying homage to The Beast after its successful launch in 1979, Scooby Doo was renamed The Beastie, and a tunnel was added to the bottom of its first drop in time for the 1980 season.  In 2006, a decision was made during the Nickelodeon Universe overhaul to remove the tunnel and rename it to Fairly Odd Coaster (based on the Nickelodeon TV show The Fairly OddParents). Although Cedar Fair had the rights to continue using the themes through 2016 following its purchase of the park in 2006, it was decided to remove all remaining Hanna-Barbera and Nickelodeon themes from the kids area in time for the start of the 2010 season. As a result, the ride went through another name change to Woodstock Express in line with the new Planet Snoopy makeover.Woodstock Express was awarded ACE Coaster Classic status, but that status has since been rescinded as a result of recent changes to the coaster.",,0,2 trains with 5 cars.

Cheetah Hunt was designed by Mark Rose, vice president of design and engineering at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay. Rose was inspired by a scene in the Star Wars film Return of the Jedi where the protagonists navigated the forests of Endor on speeder bikes. The attraction was also inspired by SeaWorld Orlando's roller coaster Manta with its combination of animal habitat and attraction. Rose initially thought of using a lift hill to reach the speed he wanted, but after realizing the height of the lift would be too tall, he incorporated the design to include a linear synchronous motor (LSM) system.Bolliger & Mabillard, among other manufacturers, were considered for the latter attraction, with Intamin ultimately being chosen because of the manufacturer's technology development and the park's expectations. In the early planning and construction stages, the roller coaster was initially called ""Cheetaka"", as a trademark was filed on April 18, 2010, for the name by SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, parent company of Busch Gardens Tampa Bay. After the park realized that the name was too hard to pronounce and didn't describe the ride, the trademark was abandoned.Construction walls and survey stakes were observed in April 2010 within the Edge of Africa section, with the Serengeti Express closed to reposition railroad track. Trenches were beginning to be dug out in May, and by June, the transportation gondola, Skyride, was closed for the rumored attraction. During that month, the park launched a teaser campaign revealing details of the attraction. The campaign featured a website that showcased videos describing the attraction's main characteristics, updates from park officials, and cutscenes of the ride's point-of-view shot video from June to August. The park released a photo on its social media account of the roller coaster's track on September 10.The construction of the foundations was completed in October 2010. The day prior to the announcement of the ride on October 12, a second trademark was filed under the name of ""Cheetah Hunt"". Cheetah Hunt was officially announced on October 13, alongside a new ""Cheetah Run"" habitat. Temporary pathways were erected during the construction of Cheetah Hunt behind the former Budweiser Clydesdales stables to reroute foot traffic. By November, vertical construction began and some supports for the ride were already in place. By mid-December, the supports for the 102-foot-tall (31 m) figure 8 element were complete with some pieces of track also installed, including the first launch section being complete.The park announced on February 17 that the attraction would open in late May. The roller coaster's trains arrived on February 28. Track work for the roller coaster was completed on March 14. It was observed that the park was completing ""walk-through tests"" on the track, a measure to ensure the trains could safely clear obstacles, in late March. Testing began for the roller coaster with water dummies in late April. Cheetah Hunt opened to the public on May 27. Another roller coaster in the park, Cheetah Chase, was renamed Sand Serpent to reduce confusion between the two roller coasters.",,1,5 trains with 4 cars.

The coaster was purchased in 2007 for a total of €2,187,000, but when construction was about to begin, the local police intervened and blocked construction on 5 March 2007, claiming that there were issues with the building permits. Permits were eventually granted on 28 September 2009, and construction began on 15 December 2010. The coaster finally opened on 6 August 2011.The delay in the construction led the park owners to seek compensation for the revenue that they claimed was lost as a result of the delay in coaster installation. The park owners demanded €3,000,000 from the city of Fasano, and threatened to remove the entire park and move its operations to Ravenna if its demands were not met. In addition, the park terminated more favorable admission rates for residents of Fasano.The sign at the entrance of the attraction is misspelled, being written as 'Eurofigther' rather than the correct 'Eurofighter' from the Gerstlauer model the attraction derives its name from.",,2,a single car.

It was themed after DC Comics' Batman rival, Harvey Dent A.K.A. Two-Face.In 2002, HangOver at Liseberg closed and was relocated to Allou Fun Park the following year. The ride, however, was never set up there and was relocated to Sommerland Syd where it operated under the name Tornado from July 2, 2005.An accident in October 2007 closed Two Face: The Flip Side at Six Flags America indefinitely. The coaster did not reopen for the 2008 season and was sold to a park in Italy. The ride reopened as Diabolik at Movieland Park for the 2015 season.
In 2008, Face/Off at Kings Island was renamed to Invertigo following the park's initiative to remove Paramount themes from the park after being sold to Cedar Fair two years prior.On January 27, 2011, California's Great America announced that Invertigo would be removed from the park and relocated to a different Cedar Fair park. Invertigo was removed and moved into storage in Allentown, Pennsylvania. During this time, the track received a new teal paint scheme, with the supports remaining in royal blue. On August 30, 2011, Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom announced that Invertigo would reopen as Stinger for the park's 2012 season. Construction of the main ride was completed in November 2011, and the station and queue closely followed. An incident on May 3, 2014, resulted in a temporary closure when the coaster experienced a rollback that injured two riders – both were transported to the hospital. During the 2017 offseason, it was announced by Dorney Park that Stinger would be removed to make way for future development. The coaster was demolished in April 2018.In 2011, Sommerland Syd's installation of Tornado closed with the ride currently being relocated to Bagatelle where it operates as Triops from June 30, 2012.On February 13, 2012, Kings Island posted a picture of Invertigo getting a new paint scheme on their Facebook page. The ride was given an aqua-colored track and royal blue supports.On December 15, 2017, Dorney Park announced on their website that Stinger would be removed. The ride was scrapped prior to the 2018 operating season. After Stinger was torn down, its train was reused on Invertigo at Kings Island.",,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Over-the-shoulder,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In July 2007 the maintenance crew ran the first test car test runs which were completed successfully.  Then in October 2007 the same crew ran the first powered complete test runs of the same test cars, and gave the roller coaster enthusiasts a tour during the Phoenix Phall Phunfest 2007.  Later that month they began to run test runs of a five-car test train which will be the full length of the train.
An initial delay was due to an issue with the roller coaster car's wheels. The wheels were shipped back to their manufacturer in California and the issue was corrected. However, the ride did not open by the end of the 2008 season due to the cars travelling too quickly for passenger comfort.
According to Knoebels' website, the ride was to be opened during the 2009 season. The ride was re-tracked and profiled to accommodate new trains.In June 2011, Knoebels posted an update to their blog, stating ""We've been testing the newest version of the Flying Turns ride vehicles and are VERY encouraged.  There's still plenty of work to do but this is a very positive step in the right direction."" They also posted to their Facebook page a video shot from a camera mounted on a prototype chassis.As of May 26, 2012, a section of track at the brake platform, as well as the brake platform itself, had been removed.
As of July 30, 2012 the removed sections have been rebuilt to accommodate the newest trains that are being delivered.
In August 2012 Knoebels said that they planned on beginning testing for the newest trains soon, and that they believed they finally figured out how to get the trains to run smoothly.
On October 5, 2013, the ride officially opened to the public, though the ride actually began operating the previous evening on October 4, 2013.

On 17 October 2012, a number of facts about the coaster were revealed to the public including its maximum speed, track length, ride time, passengers per train and ride cost. Despite the release, Alton Towers did not announce or confirm the name of the ride.",,14,5 trains with 4 cars.

The ride would have been located at the front of the park, with the ride's station situated where the Penguin Encounter exhibit exists and the main track extending out and over the car park. These plans were shelved. In December 2008, Sea World opened Jet Rescue, an Intamin JetSki Coaster.In June 2012, Sea World applied for a permit to demolish the Bermuda Triangle water ride system and the interior of its show building. The Bermuda Triangle had been sitting dormant since its closure in October 2010 and had been earmarked by the park as a site for a future attraction. On 12 July 2012, Christian von Elverfeldt from Mack Rides revealed Australia would be receiving a water roller coaster in 2013; leading to speculation that Sea World might have revived its plans. Further development application filings, and reports by the Roller Coaster DataBase and the Gold Coast Bulletin, confirmed this speculation. In September 2012, Sea World asked Austrian firm Dynamic Motion Rides (DyMoRides) to develop a theming and show design concept for the yet-to-be-announced Storm Coaster. DyMoRides was ultimately contracted for the full turnkey project in April 2013. DyMoRides subsequently contracted PEL Creative for creative direction, Full-On Lighting for lighting design, Volume One for audio and visual effects, and Sculpt Studios for theming design.Prior to the commencement of construction, Sea World announced a new attraction for 2013 and released a promotional image on their Facebook page which read ""The storm is building. It's gonna be a big one."". Demolition works began in August 2012. Due to this construction, nearby attractions, including Viking's Revenge Flume Ride, Jet Rescue and the Skyway, were intermittently closed throughout the latter part of 2012 and into 2013. The first pieces of ride track arrived on site in April 2013, with vertical construction commencing in the following month. An official announcement for Storm Coaster made by Sea World in May 2013 detailed the ride would feature 470 metres (1,540 ft) of track and a series of water and fire effects. Although an opening date of September 2013 was initially set, Sea World later revised this to be Summer 2013. By September 2013, the ride's track was complete, with focus moving towards theming and testing the ride. On 2 December 2013, Storm Coaster soft opened to the public, with an official opening held four days later.",,0,6 trains with a single car.

The land purchase was necessitated as Fun Spot of Florida faced local competition and to keep up development with its sister park, Fun Spot USA. In the early planning stages, the park explored a Skycoaster, splash pad, and roller coasters as possible additions to the expansion lot. In April 2011, Fun Spot Action Park surveyed park guests about what types of attractions they would like at the park. Consensus published by the park indicated guests wanted water rides and roller coasters.The Orlando Sentinel reported that three roller coaster representatives met with Fun Spot of Florida's chief operating officer, John Arie Jr., in August 2011. The report further stated the company planned to break ground in 2012 on the land purchased previously, which would include ""at least one new roller coaster"" among other attractions. Fun Spot announced it would rebrand its Orlando location as ""Fun Spot America"" and confirmed plans for the $20 million expansion. The expansion planned to incorporate a variety of attractions, as well as a steel and wooden roller coaster. Fun Spot officials reasoned to build two roller coasters to better establish themselves as an amusement park and to attract more guests.Mark Brisson, director of marketing at Fun Spot, described the wooden roller coaster in a December 2011 interview as having a height less than 100 feet (30 m), designed and built by Great Coasters International (GCI), and located next to a road in an ""L shaped"" configuration. In March 2012, the Orlando City Commission approved the project, and the park released concept art of the expansion; in addition to a computer animated video of the GCI-designed roller coaster. Fun Spot of Florida filed a trademark with the United States Patent and Trademark Office for the name ""White Lightning"" in May 2012. Funding of the wooden roller coaster and other attractions were approved in June 2012.After a one-year period of construction, White Lightning soft opened to the public on May 20, 2013. The park's official reopening ceremony was held on June 8, 2013. The $3.5 million ride opened as Orlando's first wooden roller coaster.In September 2020, a small part of White Lightning was retracked with new prototype steel Titan Track by Great Coasters International.",,0,2 trains with 6 cars.

In 1997, the Kidzville section of the park was built up around the ride, and the name was extended to ""Scooby-Doo's Ghoster Coaster"". Following the purchase of Paramount Parks by Cedar Fair in 2006, Scooby-Doo and all other Hanna-Barbera themes were removed, and the roller coaster became simply known as Ghoster Coaster in 2010.

However, Paramount took over operations in time to determine the ride's theme which was based on the Paramount Pictures film Top Gun.  On November 11, 1992, Kings Island announced that a new roller coaster named Top Gun would be added to the park. The ride would be an Arrow Dynamics suspended coaster, very similar to The Bat which had operated at the park in the 1980s. Construction of Top Gun began in December 1992 and was completed in early spring 1993. The park hired John DeCuir Jr., a production designer who worked on the film, to design the ride's loading platform, so that it would resemble the deck of an aircraft carrier. Top Gun opened on April 9, 1993.
Top Gun was renamed Flight Deck in 2008, two years after Cedar Fair purchased the park. The theme music and signage were changed to remove all references to the film. Cedar Fair had rights to continue using the Top Gun movie theme through 2016 but made the decision to remove all Paramount themes from the park much sooner. On October 29, 2013, the 33rd anniversary of the announcement of the original Bat, the park announced that Flight Deck would be renamed The Bat for the 2014 season.

All of the attractions opened for the season as planned, except for the Dragon Wagon roller coaster, which was postponed due to a number of delays while constructing. By late August 2014, construction ended and the ride opened with only a few seasonal operating days left. Dragon Wagon closed after the 2018 season.

The ride was subsequently removed and relocated to Six Flags America, where it reopened as Apocalypse: The Last Stand. For a brief period, Great America did not release any definitive plans for the site's replacement.In early August 2013, Six Flags Great America released a teaser campaign entitled ""Follow the Journey"". Later that month, it was revealed Six Flags Great America would be building a 165-foot-tall roller coaster (50 m), with plans to lobby the local zoning committee to exceed the 125-foot (38 m) height limit imposed on the park. The official announcement for Goliath came on August 29, 2013, where it was revealed the new wooden roller coaster would be manufactured by Rocky Mountain Construction (RMC) and open in 2014. As part of the announcement, the ride's statistics were released, along with a concept computer-animated video demonstrating the ride's layout. Situated on the site of the former Iron Wolf, Goliath utilized a majority of the station and line queue from the former ride, and the station was lengthened to accommodate the longer twelve-row trains.Final design photos were released on Great America's Facebook page on February 21, 2014. These revealed a design change in Goliath's lift hill, which was modified to an all-steel structure as opposed to the original wood design. Another computer-animated video was also released on the park's official YouTube channel the same day.Construction began in September 2013, employing a crew of approximately 35 workers by RMC. The team worked 11-hour days, six days a week through winter in occasional sub-zero temperatures finishing in May 2014, which amounted to approximately 40,000 man hours. Goliath was set to open on May 31, 2014, but the opening was delayed. The lift hill was topped off on May 16, with the first test run taking place two weeks later on May 31, the same day as the original opening. Lightning struck a small section of the ride's station on June 6, 2014, causing it to catch fire briefly before being extinguished. There were no reported injuries or major damage.

As part of this process Premier Parks would add 13 new rides, including a wooden roller coaster named Medusa. On June 2, 2000, Medusa officially opened to the public along with the refurbished and rebranded park.In late 2009, Six Flags Over Texas closed their Texas Giant wooden roller coaster for a $10 million renovation which took more than a year to complete. Idaho-firm Rocky Mountain Construction replaced the wooden track with a new steel I-Box track, retaining a wooden support structure. The refurbishment was ultimately a success with ""resoundingly positive reviews from riders"".

The lead designer was Lagoon's Dal Freeman. In an era when most amusement parks outsource the work to a select few established roller coaster manufacturers, the decision to build in-house is rare in the industry. The roller coaster features a 208-foot-tall (63 m) enclosed  elevator lift, a beyond-vertical drop of 116 degrees, a themed underground tunnel, and a 360-degree helix situated above a man-made waterfall. It also features four inversions that include a 140-foot-tall (43 m) Immelman loop, a dive loop, and a unique inversion the park calls the ""Lagoon roll,"" which consists of a counter-clockwise heartline roll immediately followed by a clockwise heartline roll. The trains, which use only lap bar restraints, travel up to 70 miles per hour (110 km/h) and pull as much as 4.2 G's.The ride had been in the planning stages for more than five years and required more than two years to construct. Prior to its planned opening in the spring of 2015, Lagoon announced that the roller coaster's debut would be postponed for additional testing and inspections. The ride officially opened on July 2, 2015. At the time of opening, Cannibal set a world record for having the tallest beyond-vertical drop among roller coasters, and became the steepest in the United States.

Wintrode worked with Walter Bolliger and Claude Mabillard – from Swiss roller coaster manufacturer Bolliger & Mabillard – along with engineer Robert Mampe to develop Batman: The Ride which opened at Six Flags Great America in 1992. Dutch amusement ride manufacturer Vekoma developed a similar concept shortly after, and the model became known as the Suspended Looping Coaster (SLC). Their first installation was El Condor at Walibi Holland which debuted in 1994.In 1995, nine parks around the world announced plans to add Vekoma SLCs, including Kentucky Kingdom. On December 1, 1994, Kentucky Kingdom announced that they would be adding a Vekoma SLC named T2. This one was identical to the original prototype at Walibi Holland, but it featured a different color scheme – red track with purple trains. T2 would officially open on April 8, 1995.

At the end of 1997, the rights to operate Kentucky Kingdom were sold to Premier Parks for $64 million. Following the acquisition, Batman and DC Comics themes were added to Kentucky Kingdom. As a result, T2 was painted black for the 1999 season. This was due to a plan by Six Flags to retheme part of the park as Gotham City, and rebrand T2 as Batman: The Ride and its next door roller coaster, Chang, as Riddler's Revenge. However, these plans never came to fruition, while T2 retained its new coat of black paint.Amid a corporate bankruptcy on February 4, 2010, Six Flags announced the park would cease operations immediately due to the rejection of an amended lease by the Kentucky State Fair Board. Under the efforts of former Kentucky Kingdom operator Ed Hart and several investors, the Kentucky Kingdom Redevelopment Company was formed to redevelop the park and reopen it. The Koch Family, owners of Holiday World & Splashin' Safari in Santa Claus, Indiana, also expressed interest in redeveloping the park. On February 23, 2012, the Kentucky Fair Board approved a lease agreement which would see the park reopen as Bluegrass Boardwalk. The plans called for the removal of T2 along with the Twisted Twins, due to age and safety concerns. However, plans soon unraveled, and the Koch family eventually withdrew from the investment.On June 27, 2013, Ed Hart's investment group negotiated an agreement to spend $36 million to reopen the park under its former name Kentucky Kingdom in 2014. Plans involved a major refurbishment of T2 with a timeline to reopen the ride in 2015. Later, it was revealed that the coaster would be renamed T3. The refurbished ride reopened on July 3, 2015, featuring renovated trains and track to provide a more comfortable experience for riders.On June 2, 2018, T3 had a minor accident as the second train bumped into the first train, which was waiting to enter the station for unloading. Five people were injured, with one being taken to the hospital. The coaster was closed for an investigation of the incident. The ride reopened two days later. T3 closed permanently following the 2022 season.","October 30, 2022",5,2 trains with 7 cars.

Hurricane, a roller coaster from bankrupt Italian manufacturer S.D.C., gave its final rides on September 13, 2014, after 22 years of operation at the park, Soon after, it was sold to Race City in Panama City Beach, Florida, where it opened for the 2015 season and still operates today. On December 26, 2014, Adventureland announced on social media that the name of the coaster would be Turbulence.Site preparation had begun after Hurricane was dismantled, and the coaster was constructed throughout the winter of 2014/2015. A March 2015 opening date was originally eyeballed, but tough weather forced significant construction delays, with the coaster being completed in late March. The coaster began conducting test runs and landscape work throughout the spring. Following a media preview on May 18, and a first rider preview earlier in the morning, Turbulence had its grand opening for a widely enthusiastic crowd at 2pm EST on May 22, 2015, with public and local dignitaries at hand for the event.On August 2, 2017, two years after opening, Turbulence welcomed its one millionth rider, who was awarded with 2017 and 2018 park season passes and a prize pack of ride merchandise.",,0,2 trains with 3 cars.

Owners Danny and Sarah Donhauser named the park after their three children – Zac, Danielle, and Tiffany – using the first letter of each name. Multi-level go-karts were added in 2008, and Mad Raft Water Coaster, a water coaster that was the park's first water ride, opened in 2011.In late 2014, ZDT's unveiled plans to build Switchback, a wooden shuttle roller coaster that features a 104-degree overbanked turn and a record-breaking, 87-degree incline. Manufactured by The Gravity Group, the 63-foot-tall (19 m) ride drops riders 58 feet (18 m) and reaches speeds of up to 40 mph (64 km/h). The custom-designed roller coaster opened to the public on October 17, 2015. It navigates through and around various buildings and structures ending in a culminating finale element called the Grand Spike, which sends riders upward an 87-degree incline. Switchback is the first and only wooden shuttle coaster of its kind and derives its name from the 1884 Switchback Railway, considered to have been the first coaster in United States.The theme of the ride also celebrates the history of the property on which the park is built with its locomotive-themed train cars. The park grounds were once an agricultural and grocery center containing within the block of land everything from grain silos to meat processing. All of the buildings in the park were remodeled from their original purposes instead of being torn down and rebuilt. The Silo Climb, for example, is a climbing wall built on the facade of the silos that once stored the grain of local farmers. The indoor section of the GoKarts runs through the warehouses in which that grain was processed, where one can see hanging above some of the original equipment used for this process. The main building of the park was once a grocery center that would have stored and readied the finished product for sale. The walkway to the water park is built atop the old train tracks which were used to transport that product to other areas, and an original Santa Fe executive train car still sits along this walkway in part to commemorate this history.",,0,2 trains with 4 cars.

In February 2015, Busch Gardens Tampa Bay officials acknowledged a new attraction would be constructed in the Egypt portion of the park but did not elaborate further. During the same month, permits filed through the Southwest Florida Water Management District outlined a project titled ""BGT 2016 Attraction"" were uncovered. The permit detailed the removal of 28,349 square feet (2,633.7 m2) of concrete, specified the expansion of 11,605 square feet (1,078.1 m2) of an existing attraction space known as King Tut's Tomb, and the addition of another 40,751 square feet (3,785.9 m2) consisting of trenches and concrete paths. Construction for the new attraction in the Egypt area of the park began in March 2015. The park announced on March 17, 2015, that the Serengeti Railway would be temporarily closed for a new attraction that would be along its route in 2016.SeaWorld Entertainment, the parent company of Busch Gardens Tampa Bay, filed the trademark ""Cobra's Curse"" with the United States Patent and Trademark Office on May 8, 2015.  Busch Gardens Tampa Bay officials revealed plans to build a new roller coaster that was manufactured by Mack Rides and would be called Cobra's Curse on May 28, 2015, which was expected to open in 2016. Busch Gardens President Jim Dean commented that Cobra's Curse would be a complement to ""the selection of thrill rides Busch Gardens offers.""Throughout the construction of the roller coaster, Jeff Hornick, the regional director of design and engineering at SeaWorld Entertainment, gave updates on the progression of the roller coaster's construction starting in July 2015. The general construction of the roller coaster was handled by PCL Construction. Vertical construction of the roller coaster track began on October 9, 2015 in the middle of the layout due to space constraints within the section of the park. During the November 2015 International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions (IAAPA) Convention in Orlando, Florida, Mack Rides revealed additional details and a scale model of Cobra's Curse.Media outlets were given a tour of the roller coaster's progress on February 17, 2016, during which the roller coaster's trains and further information on the ride's theme were revealed. On February 29, 2016, the headpiece of the roller coaster's snake statue ""King Venymyss"" was installed. The final piece of track was installed on March 19, 2016, which was announced three days later. Busch Gardens Tampa Bay released an on-ride point-of-view video of the attraction on May 11, 2016. On May 28, 2016, the construction walls surrounding the attraction were removed. The Orlando Sentinel reported that the Cobra's Curse was nearly completed by June 6, 2016 when the park released a construction update and another POV video of the roller coaster.

When it debuted on May 14, 1999, Roar was the park's first wooden roller coaster and one of its first rides overall during the transition of adding amusement park rides to the marine mammal park. The coaster featured a height of 94 feet (29 m), a first drop of 85 feet (26 m) and a top speed of 50 mph (80 km/h).In July 2015, Six Flags announced plans to permanently close Roar on August 16, 2015. On September 3, 2015, the park revealed plans to resurrect and convert Roar into a steel-tracked coaster called The Joker for the 2016 season. Rocky Mountain Construction was contracted to perform the renovation using the company's patented I-Box steel track technology married to the existing wooden support structure. The wood-steel hybrid was designed to incorporate three inversions, including a new element described as a ""step-up under-flip inverted roll"", and it also received new trains themed to the Joker comic book character.Based on the success of previous roller coaster conversions in its partnership with Rocky Mountain Construction, Six Flags anticipated that Roar would benefit from the overhaul and transition into The Joker.

On September 1, 2016, Six Flags announced that Six Flags Great America, Six Flags New England and Six Flags Over Texas would install the roller coaster into their parks for the 2017 season.
The night before opening the roller coaster on May 20, 2017, Over Texas hosted an all-night private event which had The Joker opened only to the event attendees. A storm that was producing strong winds came into the area, which triggered the ride to halt while in operation while eight passengers were on board. During the stoppage, the storm got more severe, preventing the ride to be fixed soon, so the park called emergency services to come help rescue the passengers that were on the ride. The rescue operation took over three hours, bringing each passenger down individually the 120-foot-tall roller coaster while the storm was overhead. None of the riders were injured that night, and the park suspended the roller coaster operations on the following day for safety inspections.

The memo stated that the ride may be installed on land formerly occupied by the Good Time Theatre, which was demolished a few months earlier. The park's spokesman, Bryan Edwards, later confirmed that the Dive Coaster was one of several possibilities the park was considering.Site preparation began in late December 2014, when the Dodgems and Calypso rides were relocated to the Lakeside midway section of the park. The Good Time Theatre and Turnpike Cars were demolished and removed as well in early 2015. In May 2015, interest in the new ride grew when Cedar Point trademarked the name Valravn, which in Danish folklore stands for a mythological bird known as the ""raven of the slain"", describing a raven that feasts on the dead bodies of those who perish in battle. In early August of the same year, images showing the layout of the new roller coaster and its logo appeared in the amusement park's smartphone app. Responding to the leak, Cedar Point temporarily disabled the app on Google Play and announced that details would be revealed on August 18, 2015. However, the park decided to postpone the announcement following an incident in which a park visitor was struck and killed when entering a restricted area underneath Raptor. Visitors began to report seeing pieces of new roller coaster track being stored on park property. On September 9, 2015, Cedar Point officially unveiled plans for Valravn.The roller coaster is based on the Dive Coaster model developed by B&M and is also the company's hundredth roller coaster installation. Its trains were the first on this model to use a ""vest"" style over-the-shoulder restraint system, similar to the design used on Cedar Point's GateKeeper and other B&M Wing Coasters. Each train consists of three cars, each of which has a single row holding eight passengers, for a total of 24 riders per train. Construction finished as Valravn's last piece of track was put in place on March 2, 2016. Video showing the ride being tested was released in early April 2016.",,3,3 trains with 3 cars.

The €4,000,000 attraction would feature two side-by-side tracks that would have riders board at the top of an 82-foot (25 m) tall tower and slide down to the bottom, with the attraction set to open in 2017. Construction began soon after, and continued throughout the winter, with track first being installed on the support structure in January.On 27 January 2017, during a press conference at the attraction's construction site, park officials unveiled the name of the ride to be Dawson Duel, after the Canadian town, Dawson City, Yukon. An animated 3D simulation of the ride structure and experience was subsequently released on YouTube. Following the ride's completion and weeks of test runs, Dawson Duel opened to the public on 5 May 2017. The ride quickly became one of the park's most popular attractions, and throughout the 2017 season wait times would fluctuate between an average 40-70 minutes.For the 2018 season, following excessive wait times caused by the low capacity, Bellewaerde and Wiegand made several modifications to the ride system that would raise its capacity by an estimated 50%. The loading procedure and brake test system was optimized, and six new cars were purchased, thus enabling the ride to run more carts on the track. The modifications were inspected and approved by the third-party T.U.V. service company. In 2019, two years after the coaster opened, Bellewaerde would continue to combat long wait times and begin testing a virtual queue system using the smartphone app Lineberty.",,0,46 trains with a single car.

For those familiar with the park, the announcement came to no surprise, as in the years prior the deteriorating Thunder Loop had become an increasingly costly and often unpredictable asset, having failed multiple technical inspections during that time. Slagharen director Wouter Dekkers stated on multiple occasions that the attraction had long been on the nomination list for removal, but was kept in operation solely because of the park's need to have a major anchor coaster. Because of this factor, park officials also promised to construct a major new replacement coaster for the 2017 season, which would have a western theme to fit in with the park and occupy a larger footprint.The park would gradually release select details of the replacement attraction over the summer of 2016. In August, it was reported that the ride would be named Gold Rush and be manufactured by German firm Gerstlauer, with leaked snippets of hardware renderings finding their way onto the internet. Gold Rush was formally announced and unveiled on September 8, 2016, packing in two inversions and a triple launch system that was a first for the Netherlands. Thunder Loop's final day of operations was on October 2, after which it was dismantled and sold off. The attraction was refurbished and sent to Parko Paliatso in Cyprus, where it began operation in 2018 and today operates under the name Looping Star.In January 2017, Gold Rush's track and other hardware began to arrive, and the dive loop became the first part of the coaster to go vertical in mid-February. The rest of the ride quickly followed and was completed within the month, with the single train arriving on March 16, 2017. Testing, landscaping, and the application of many of the themed elements was undertaken soon after.
Gold Rush officially opened to great public fanfare on April 13, 2017. A week after opening, however, Slagharen officials closed the attraction indefinitely, citing weak concrete foundations that would require significant reinforcement.

Vertical construction began shortly after, and wrapped up on January 17, 2018. During a media tour on the same date, to commemorate the construction wrap-up, the ride's trains were first unveiled. On March 29, 2018, amid the ride's test runs, SeaWorld officials set Electric Eel's opening date for May 12, 2018. However, on April 17, the date was changed to two days earlier than originally planned, to May 10, while park representatives cited the project to be well-ahead of schedule.

Soon after on 1 December 2016, construction on the ride began, and on 30 March 2017 the foundations for the ride were around 80 percent completed with 282 concrete cylinders driven for main pilings. On 10 April 2017, the park announced the official name of the ride, Icon.

The ride would replace Thunder Rapids, the park's log flume. The ride name was announced to be Tantrum in November, and the park planned on an opening in May 2018. The ride was recommended by the county planning board, and sent to the planning board of the town of Darien.The Darien town planning board reviewed the plan on November 20, 2017, but requested further information on the site plan.

This would be kickstarted with the addition of a new family coaster, to be built near the Challenge of Tutankhamon Dark ride at the south end of the park and include an exotic theme. Construction of the new coaster and revitalization of the surrounding area would require the removal of the existing Coccinelle children's coaster, which would be refurbished and rebuilt on the site of the former Ferris wheel, beside the Loup-Garou wooden coaster, for the 2022 season and receive a New Orleans theme.The Coccinelle had its final day of operations on September 11, 2017, and was dismantled immediately, with the station being razed and site preparation beginning shortly after. During the park's annual Walibi Belgium Fan Day event, on October 21, 2017, an animation of the ride's draft layout was screened for attendees, confirming the coaster to be a Gerstlauer custom Bobsled Coaster creation. Construction continued at a rapid pace throughout the winter, and on February 15, 2018, park officials announced the ride's name to be Tiki-Waka at a press conference by the ride's construction site, where concept artwork for the ride trains were also revealed. The 2018 investments, which included an expansion of the Aqualibi Waterpark, were confirmed to have cost the park roughly €12,000,000 of their planned €100 million masterplan, with the Exotic World tallying around 7.8 million euros of that figure.Construction on Tiki-Waka was completed on March 1, 2018. Despite the park's best efforts to have the ride ready to begin public operations by a target date of March 31, 2018, a Facebook announcement from the park eventually confirmed on March 21 that such would not be the case.

In January 2016, while a prototype for a new spinning roller coaster concept was being made by Mack Rides, Jane Cooper, chief operating officer and president of Herschend Family Entertainment, and Brad Thomas, president of attractions for Silver Dollar City, went to test it at Europa-Park where it was featured on the roller coaster Blue Fire. During their first trip, Thomas described the first experience on the prototype they had ""like a teacup"", but showed promise for the project and design. Thereafter, both Cooper and Thomas made several trips to Europa-Park to discuss and plan the ride's concept with Mack Rides before acquiring the model for the park's new attraction.From February 2016, Herschend Family Entertainment (owner of Silver Dollar City) filed trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office for multiple names including ""Barke"", ""Time Traveler"", and ""Top Dog"". During one of the several trips in June 2016, the name of the attraction was conceived from Cooper and Thomas' observation of the roller coaster's train design frame. Construction for the roller coaster began in October 2016. On February 15, 2017, photos were taken by the Springfield News-Leader of construction taking place within the park, with a park official acknowledging that footers were in place for a new attraction, but not confirming what it would be.Silver Dollar City announced ""Time Traveler"" on August 16, 2017, which upon completion would be the tallest, fastest and longest spinning roller coaster in the world. The ride was announced to be manufactured by Mack Rides at the cost of $26 million to design and build. Among its records, the roller coaster would be the only spinning roller coaster with a double launch, vertical loop, and three inversions. On September 19, 2017, the final piece of track was placed for the attraction, with a park spokesman saying that the ride was about 50 percent complete.The trains for the ride were officially revealed on November 14, 2017 during the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions (IAAPA) Attraction Exposition 2017. The roller coaster's first test runs began on December 14, 2017. In February 2018, Silver Dollar City announced that the roller coaster would open coinciding with the park's seasonal operations. A media day was held on March 13, 2018 for the ride which included 150 guests, with the ride officially opening on March 14, 2018. Originally the ride was to be sponsored by White River Valley Electric, a supplier for the park's electricity. However, the five-year deal was canceled soon after its announcement following concerns from the company's members and board of directors.Time Traveler experienced maintenance delays early in its tenure, closing often each week for a short period of time due to sensor issues and high temperatures. Excess heat caused the train to run faster, and parameter settings on the ride early on needed to be tweaked. For significant delays, guests would be offered ""front of the line"" passes to compensate for lost time. The park set attendance records in 2018, attributing in part to the opening of Time Traveler.",,3,3 trains with 4 cars.

Planning documents were submitted to Staffordshire Moorlands District Council on 23 April 2016. They documented the basic layout of the project, named ""Secret Weapon 8"" (SW8), and the surrounding area. The plans included retaining The Flume's former station building as a 'Smokehouse' restaurant, but this idea was dropped and the station was demolished. The Planning Applications Committee approved the plans on 25 August 2016.Great Coasters International (GCI) manufactured the roller coaster, and its layout was primarily designed by Skyline Design, LLC. Audio and visual effects were handled by Alton Towers in coordination with Merlin Magic Making (MMM), an in-house division of Merlin Entertainment, along with Holovis and Backstage Technologies. Retired attraction developer John Wardley was brought in at a late stage to consult on the ride. He stated that he was ""very impressed with the basic layout, the choice of manufacturer, and the theming concept"" but criticised the ride's profile, in particular calling the first drop ""atrocious"". The first two drops were subsequently redesigned based on ideas he submitted, but the project was too far into development to alter other areas he described as lacking ""major thrill"".Construction on the new ride commenced on 28 November 2016 with the demolition of The Flume. In 2017, a path leading from Mutiny Bay to Katanga Canyon was closed for the season for vehicle access to the construction site. The coaster's main structure – consisting of the station, shop and queue – was started in March 2017. The first timber for the coaster arrived at Alton Towers on 4 May 2017. The lift hill's construction reached its highest point in early July, and by October 2017, sections of track were installed. 
A countdown began on Alton Towers' social media accounts in early January 2018, each day displaying a photo of each of the previous ""Secret Weapon"" roller coasters. On the eighth day, when all of the previous roller coasters had been displayed, the park announced the ride's name to be Wicker Man.Wicker Man opened to the general public on 20 March 2018, three days behind schedule due to inclement weather.

The attraction is one of the only coasters in the United States to feature a free-fall vertical drop, and it cost an estimated $300 million to construct.Robbie Coltrane, who portrayed Rubeus Hagrid in the Harry Potter films and theme park attractions, reprised the role again for the roller coaster's pre-show and ride experience. Filming took place at Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden in 2018 with Coltrane and Mark Williams, who reprised the role of Arthur Weasley for the pre-show, as well. Due to declining health, Coltrane's performance was filmed face-and-head only, while British actor Greg Draven was used as a body double for Hagrid; it was Robbie Coltrane's final performance as Hagrid before his death in 2022. The grand opening ceremony took place on June 11, 2019 with actors Evanna Lynch, Warwick Davis, Tom Felton, Rupert Grint and James and Oliver Phelps in attendance. Robbie Coltrane was unable to attend due to his health, however, he recorded video messages for the occasion.Unlike most Universal Orlando Attractions, Hagrid's Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure does not offer an Express queue. The queue options available are Standby, Single Riders, and an “Accommodations” queue. Just a day after opening, a reserved virtual line system was implemented for the attraction, through Universal Orlando's mobile application. Due to the coronavirus pandemic and its spread to Florida, the single rider line was made unavailable upon the resort's June 2020 reopening, but was reopened on June 15, 2021.",,0,10 trains with 7 cars.

The plans were approved on April 24, 2019. Cedar Fair also applied for national trademarks for the names Orion and Polaris as a marketing teaser tactic to keep enthusiasts guessing between the two. On August 15, 2019, Kings Island held an evening event open to both the media and public that officially announced the new coaster as Orion. It was confirmed to have a 300-foot drop (91 m), making it the seventh giga coaster in the world.

Concept artwork from as early as November 2017 showed the then-unnamed compact launch coaster located at the back of the park, and in January 2019, construction company Ride Entertainment Group would share images of the coaster layout. On February 2, 2019, American Dream officials held a press conference at the ACE EastCoaster event at Hersheypark in Hershey, Pennsylvania, where four of the park's coasters were revealed. Sandy's Blasting Bronco was revealed to be the name of the coaster, presumably tying in with the SpongeBob SquarePants character Sandy Cheeks.
Although the Nickelodeon Universe Theme Park would open to the public on October 25, 2019, Sandy's Blasting Bronco would not open until nearly a year later. It was initially among a group of rides that had not yet been certified by the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs as ready to operate. Speculation on the cause(s) would ensue for several months, with various unverified reports and rumors attempting to explain its delayed opening until the park was forced to shut down in March due to the emerging COVID-19 pandemic. With no reopening date for the American Dream mall set by Summer 2020, as well as various reports of financial trouble from Triple Five, the mall's future was brought into question, and a possibility of the complex not reopening became widely discussed.In August 2020, Triple Five struck an agreement with lenders in order to avoid foreclosure on the Mall of America, thus aiding in keeping the American Dream mall - and Nickelodeon Universe - afloat. After State Governor Phil Murphy green-lit the reopening of indoor amusement parks, Nickelodeon Universe reopened on October 1, 2020.

Working closely with the local Nature and Forest Agency, the park later resubmitted plans further detailing the environmental impact and how they would compensate for any trees felled. The project received final approval in September 2019.Land clearing began immediately following approval, and track would begin arriving in and around early January 2020.

The next day, construction crews began the process of dismantling the Dragon, which had grown old and was in a steadily deteriorating shape to the point that it had become extremely uncomfortable to ride. All of the ride except the coaster's two signature vertical loops were taken down; these will be left standing as a monument for the time being. Two days later, the park posted a second teaser, a rotating GIF confirming the new unknown ride, and text revealing the name of the attraction; Dragon Slayer. A month later, after arriving track parts and hardware were identified by roller coaster enthusiasts, Dragon Slayer was confirmed by the park to be an S&S Sansei Freespin roller coaster, in line with the suspicions of many. The ride would be located on the plot of land next to the park's Tornado wooden coaster, which was formerly occupied by Dragon's double helix finale.Dragon Slayer was constructed during the fall of 2020, with foundations being poured during August and September, and the ride beginning vertical construction in early October. Construction of the track and supports was finished by early November 2020, and the ride's first test run took place on March 23, 2021. Dragon Slayer opened to the public on May 29, 2021.",,,2 cars.

This backed up earlier reports that park director Steve Van den Kerkhof had been spotted inspecting the Time Traveler spinning coaster at Silver Dollar City in the U.S. state of Missouri. On September 24, Van den Kerkhof unveiled plans for the attraction under the working title Robo-Spinner, confirming that it would indeed be a Mack Rides Xtreme Spinning Coaster. The coaster was said at the time to represent an investment of €15,000,000 and had been pushed up towards a 2021 opening. Land clearing began in the fall of 2019.On December 21, 2019, Plopsaland released an official animated rendering of the Robo-Spinner, which would feature five inversions and two launches. Under the new working title Time Traveler, the support footers were completed over the spring and summer of 2020, and ride track first began to arrive on-site in October 2020. Vertical construction commenced in the fall, helmed by attraction construction firm RCS GmbH, and the coaster's track was completed on December 17, 2020.On January 15, 2021, Plopsaland unveiled the ride's name and theme; The Ride to Happiness, themed to the annual Tomorrowland electronic dance music festival held in Boom, Belgium. The ride's trains were delivered to the park on March 11. The Ride to Happiness began testing later that month, and in early April, Van den Kerkhof became one of the coaster's first human test riders.

Between July and September 2018, Paulton's Park filed multiple trademarks with the IPO for the following names; ROUTE 83, STORM CHASER, and AL'S AUTO ACADEMY. During the fall, the park relocated various animal enclosures to other parts of the property, clearing a sizable construction site. In November, a Twitter account representing the tourism bureau of the fictional town Tornado Springs was created and immediately connected to the park's future developments. By this point, it had become apparent that Paultons Park was working on their next major project.
Paultons Park launched an extensive social media campaign marketing the new project, creating multiple Twitter accounts and even an official website for the town of Tornado Springs, which began to distribute artwork and teaser posters throughout much of 2020. During a March 2019 interview with InterPark Magazine, park owner Richard Mancey stated that a new themed area was due to open in 2020, with 5 new attractions intended for children, as well as a ""world class"" roller coaster. Using artwork teased during the promotional campaign and roller coaster footers beginning to take shape on the construction site, roller coaster enthusiasts eventually determined that this would likely be a spinning coaster from German manufacturer Mack Rides. In May 2019, Danish creative firm MK Themed Attractions confirmed that they had been contracted to handle the Tornado Springs' theming elements.Tornado Springs was formally announced and unveiled in full on 4 July 2019. It would cover 4 acres (1.6 hectares), include multiple family and thrill rides, and feature a headlining attraction in the form of Storm Chaser, the rumored Mack Rides spinning coaster. Vertical construction of Storm Chaser began in late September, and its final track piece was placed and the coaster topped off on 17 October 2019. Theming and props were installed throughout the fall and winter, and an opening timeframe was set for May 2020.However, in April 2020, the emerging COVID-19 pandemic forced the park to postpone the opening of Tornado Springs to Easter 2021. Paultons' representatives expressed their disappointment of the delay, but assured that the new area and its rides would be opened the following year. Thus, the area stayed closed when the park was eventually safely reopened, although the site didn't remain dormant. Storm Chaser's first train arrived in March 2020, and testing of the ride first began on 16 July 2020.On 23 September 2020 Paultons officially announced an opening date of 19 March 2021 for Storm Chaser and Tornado Springs. However, during the fall/winter of 2020–2021, the United Kingdom re-entered a national lockdown in response to a surge in COVID-19 cases. The second lockdown once again renewed uncertainty over the planned opening date. On 22 February 2021 Prime Minister Boris Johnson presented a four-step plan to ease restrictions, which would allow theme parks to reopen no later than 12 April. As the park's reopening schedule became further solid, the opening date was shifted to 12 April 2021, where it remained. The first on-ride point-of-view of Storm Chaser was released on 8 April 2021. As intended, Storm Chaser opened alongside Tornado Springs on 12 April 2021.",,0,2 trains with 4 cars.

Permits were filed with the FAA, which were uncovered by the public in June 2020 following a series of intentional leaks by the park on social media. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, Kentucky Kingdom backed out of the project, and its FAA filing was officially withdrawn in December 2020.After development stalled at Kentucky Kingdom, Silverwood Theme Park picked up the project, and began teasing a similar attraction through social media on September 3, 2020. The single-rail coaster was unveiled as Stunt Pilot on September 17, 2020, with its aerobatics theme meant to commemorate Silverwood's aviation history and daily air shows that were once on display from 1988 to 1996. The park is located on the former Henley Aerodrome airfield. Daily air shows ended following a fatal crash during an air show at Fairchild Air Force Base on September 15, 1996.Construction of the new ride began in early 2021, with sections of track arrived in February 2021.

The then-unpublicized Wildcat coaster layout was offered as an option, but was leaked online in December 2019 by another prospective client, the proposed (and failed) Magic Land park in Bosnia. Officials from Magic Land were alleged to have broken a non-disclosure agreement for marketing purposes, resulting in a significant amount of attention being drawn to the concept, although it was not connected to Fårup Sommerland until its formal announcement.
In March 2021, Fårup Sommerland received approval from the Jammerbugt Municipality to build a coaster under the working title Woodland, which would stand 37 meters tall and occupy a surface area of 9700 m2. Three years earlier, the park had already received approval to build structures standing up to 40 meters tall within their perimeter. Land preparation began in April, where the park began clearing out trees on the eastern side of the property. Speculation quickly centered around Vekoma, who in recent months had begun teasing a major 2020 coaster project in Europe with ""award winning potential"". Using park teasers, fans eventually determined the name of the new coaster to be Fønix (Danish for ""Phoenix"").Fønix was formally announced on June 23, 2021, an attraction set to shatter domestic records and become Denmark's tallest and fastest coaster, surpassing Piraten at Djurs Sommerland. An animated rendering was also released by Vekoma. In July 2021, the first track pieces began to arrive at the park. The lift hill was topped off in October 2021.

Ellen's Energy Adventure closed on August 13, 2017 and construction of the roller coaster began later in the same month. The show building that housed Universe of Energy was reused and retrofitted for the new attraction. The roller coaster itself is housed in a new, massive show building situated backstage behind the Universe of Energy building and the PLAY! pavilion, which utilized 960 truckloads of concrete for its foundation. The first track piece of the ride was installed November 2018.At D23 Japan in 2018, it was confirmed that the ride would be one of the world's longest enclosed roller coasters, set to open during the 50th anniversary celebration of Walt Disney World, late 2021.The name of the ride, Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind, was announced on August 25, 2019, at the D23 Expo 2019. Much like its sister attraction Guardians of the Galaxy – Mission: Breakout! at Disney's California Adventure, the attraction cannot use the Marvel brand in its title or in advertising due to the 1994 contract with Universal Parks & Resorts, which pre-dates Disney's 2009 purchase of Marvel Entertainment.Filming for the ride commenced in October 2021. Guardians of the Galaxy film series cast members Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldaña, Dave Bautista, and Glenn Close reprised their roles from the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) as Peter Quill / Star-Lord, Gamora, Drax, and Nova Prime Irani Rael, respectively. The first footage from the ride was released in March 2022. Disney Parks, through social media, also revealed on April 25, 2022, that actor Terry Crews would be part of the pre-show experience, playing Centurion Tal Marik, a new character created specifically for the attraction.Cast Member previews for the attraction began on April 17, 2022, while Walt Disney World Annual Passholders received an early look at the ride beginning on May 8, 2022. The attraction eventually held its grand opening ceremony on May 27, 2022, opening to the public on the same day.

Alongside the Vortex top spin and the Trident (star flyer) was the Leviathan wooden roller coaster, which was set to be Australia's first new wooden coaster since Bush Beast at Wonderland Sydney in 1985. Leviathan would include backwards facing seats and claim multiple Australian wooden coaster records. The investment was made with the intention of rejuvenating the neglected Sea World after dwindling attendance and a hit to the domestic theme park industry following the 2016 Thunder River Rapids Ride incident at Dreamworld, which killed four people. In addition, the announcement coincided with that of the Queensland Government's $60,000,000 Spit Masterplan on the Gold Coast.Leviathan was originally slated to open in December 2020, and managed to keep its timeline when the Trident was pushed back to 2021, with park COO Bikash Randhawa confirming that Leviathan was being prioritized. However, the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in Leviathan's timeline being pushed back to its current opening date of 2nd December 2022.The concrete slab for the coaster's foundations was completed by July 2020, and the coaster went vertical soon after. On 1 December 2020, the ride's train design and further concept artwork were revealed. A few days later, the highest point of the ride was topped off. Vertical construction began wrapping up in April 2021, and the coaster was set to open on 18 September 2021; however, the opening date was once again pushed to late 2021. Later in the year, this date was again pushed to April 2022, and once again pushed to September 2022. Currently, Leviathan has an official opening date of the 2nd of December, 2022.  
On August 4, 2022, the official Sea World Facebook page posted a video of the Leviathan on its first test run, showing the train navigating the track. Sea World also announced on this post that the team has begun official ride testing with the ride's manufacturer and confirmed that Leviathan would open in late 2022. Currently, the release date is scheduled at December 2nd 2022, alongside the Trident. 
During late October and early November of 2022, Sea World's social media pages begun to reveal behind the scenes footage of the progress of the coaster. This includes the design reveal of the 24-passenger Timberliner train, revealing the theming of the queue and station and footage of the three modeled Atlantic themed statues that have since been situated within the precint for theming.

A project codenamed ""Project Penguin"" was revealed in January 2020 after site-work plans were filed with Orange County officials for a new attraction in 2021. The new project was planned to be built toward the front of the park near a pathway that runs along Bayside Stadium. The area had been used in the past for festivals in the park. Subsequent plans were made in June and September 2020, which also confirmed the new project to be a ""custom launch coaster"" featuring a stand-up restraint design. Early reports speculated that the Surf Coaster model would be built at SeaWorld Orlando.Teasers for SeaWorld Orlando's new roller coaster began in April 2022. A picture of trees with roller coaster track in the background was depicted in the first teaser. Construction fencing began appearing along the surrounding area. In June 2022, the park teased with the warning, ""High surf advisory"". The teaser warning would later be used as a hashtag to tease and promote the roller coaster on social media. Due to the fallout from Hurricane Ian in September 2022, the official unveiling of the new coaster in an announcement was delayed.The final teaser video was released in early October 2022. In the video, the attraction's construction progress was on display. On October 18, 2022, the park officially unveiled Pipeline: The Surf Coaster in an announcement. The scheduled opening was revealed to be spring of 2023. It was marketed as the first surf coaster in the world. Track construction went vertical in late October 2022. Pipeline's trains were put on display at the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions (IAAPA) Expo on November 15, 2022.Construction of the track completed a month later on December 19, 2022, which was followed by testing in March 2023. The official opening date was revealed as May 27, 2023, with a soft opening preview period for passholders starting on May 12, 2023.",,1,2 trains with 6 cars.

It became one of the most popular rides among guests and operated until 1997, when it was removed and relocated to Parque del Café in Colombia, reopening as Montaña Rusa in 1999.For its 50th anniversary, Worlds of Fun made the decision to add a new roller coaster to its ride lineup that would pay homage to original Zinger as a ""nostalgic nod to the past"". The reimagined version was designed to feature some similarities to the original, including a spiral lift hill, a mid-course tunnel, and the same line queue building with revamped theming. It was built in the same location as the former Zinger.The coaster was originally planned to debut on May 26, 2023, but the official opening was delayed due to ongoing testing. The park began offering occasional rides to the public as early as June 10, upsetting raffle winners of the coaster's ""First Riders Experience"", which was postponed indefinitely. In response to complaints, the park clarified that the coaster was not yet officially open but that rides ""may be given from time to time"". The grand opening for Zambezi Zinger was finally held on June 19.
